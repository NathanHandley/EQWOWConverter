They are not gifted with the vision of the Dark Reflection and thus are blind to the necessity of our actions. In the Steamfont Mountains you will find a Cleric of the Deep Muses, Vyntok Bonkle. Vyntok has been aiding others of our enemies in their mission to eliminate the Dark Reflection from Ak'Anon. Find Vyntok and slay him. When you have accomplished this task return to me with Vyntok's Mace.||||||
30148|akanon|Derthix_Gibblix|say|It is good you returned with this. I almost thought you had lost to Vyntok, or worse become merciful to his cause. I suppose a reward is in order. A mace for a mace, now go forth and spread the word of Bertoxxulous.||||||
30149|akanon|Drekon_Vebnebber|say|Why, thank you. Hey!! This log indicates some messy business is going on at the scrapyard. Something happened to a group of gnomes. They never came out!! Go check out the scrapyard! I believe the rumors of Red 5 are true.||||||
30150|akanon|Drekon_Vebnebber|say|Oh my! It seems two of the obsolete duster models were not fully shut down. You must find them. They could be anywhere in Ak'Anon! After you destroy them, take their scraps to Sanfyrd Montop. He is the operator of the scrapyard.||||||

30151|akanon|Drigaz_Grumblegrowl|say|I had hoped to see the last of these sorrowful symbols. There is little I can tell you of the details of the kobold religion as I was rescued from death as a pup by the Deep Muses and reunited with Brell Serilis. What I know is this, the deity this symbol represents is named Rolfron Zek. He was a devoted shaman of Brell before the Abandonment, now he is the lord of Despair and Hopelessness. There is a shaman of Rolfron that teaches the local kobolds, he carries with him a doctrine. Recover the doctrine and take it with this translation scroll back to your Temple||||||
30152|akanon|Eonis_Mournunder|say|Hmmm... As you wish, we will train you in our dark ways. But know this: our art carries a high price, and there is no turning back for you now.||||||
30153|akanon|Evah_Xokez|say|Join us in fulfilling teh will of Bertoxxulous. You can train with us here, in the shadows of the Abbey. Wear this tunic to help conceal your true identity.||||||
30154|akanon|Evah_Xokez|say|I hope you enjoyed the thrill of your first lesson and the awakening of your vision. Now you must prove your utility to our society. Take this airtight container and gather the components for another dose of the plague rat disease.||||||
30155|akanon|Evah_Xokez|say|It appears that you truly seek to expand your vision into the Dark Reflection,  $N. I grant you the Initiate Symbol of Bertoxxulous!||||||
30156|akanon|Garret_Zethkog|say|There are many through out Norrath who oppose the Dark Reflection. Even here in our home, Ak'Anon, the Eldrich Collective and the Deep Muses oppose us and wish to see us exiled or eradicated. A Paladin of the Deep Muses, Donlix Bonkle, has been leading a group of zealots that is hunting young members of the Dark Reflection in the Steamfont Mountains. Seek Donlix Bonkle and eliminate him. When you have accomplished this task return to me with Donlix's Short Sword.||||||
30157|akanon|Garret_Zethkog|say|Ah! Donlix's sword! You have done well to bring this to me... but oh! Look at your corruption seep into it. I think now this sword belongs to you. Use it well.||||||
30158|akanon|Garret_Zethkog|say|Welcome to the Dark Reflection,  $N ! Take this tunic as a gift for your desire to serve the will of Bertoxxulous, The Plague Lord. Beware of the followers of Brell Serilis, they would see us members of the Dark Reflection exiled from Ak'Anon.||||||
30159|akanon|Glerbella_Gibblix|say|To assemble a Plague Raiser Breastplate you will need to obtain four bricks of crude bronze and smelt them in a forge with a Water Flask and this Crude Breastplate Mold. Once that is done combine the Crude Bronze Breastplate with a Coyote Pelt, a Clockwork Spider Thorax Plate, and two Ebon Drake Wings in the Mail Assembly Kit.||||||
30160|akanon|Glerbella_Gibblix|say|Hail  $N! You must be one of Derthix new disciples. Derthix has asked me to help get you outfitted in a suit of armor to protect you from the weapons of our foes. I have assembled a kit for you that will allow you to construct the armor pieces once you have gathered the necessary components. The required components vary according to which piece of Plague Raiser Armor you are planning on assembling. Do you wish to craft a plague raiser helm, a plague raiser bracer, plague raiser gauntlets, plague raiser boots, plague raiser vambraces, plague raiser greaves, or a plague raiser breastplate.||||||
30161|akanon|Iony_Gredlong|say|I need 3 Flawless Harpy Claws and 1 Ebon Drake Backbone still to have all the items necessary to craft this new mace. Once I have these items I can make a Shortnobles Walking Staff. For your trouble I will offer you my first staff made should I be able to create one. I hope to see you soon!||||||
30162|akanon|Iony_Gredlong|say|Thank you! Here, take this staff and good luck on your journey.||||||
30163|akanon|Iony_Gredlong|say|Welcome to the Abbey of Deep Musing.  Here you can train and raise your abilities to the peak of perfection. Take this tunic and wear it with pride.||||||
30164|akanon|Jarah_Reskan|say|I heard our shipment made it back safely. These heads will send a message to any other thief that plans on robbing our cargo shipments. Thank you  $N, take this coin as your reward. I’m sorry to say we’re currently out of masks.||||||
30165|akanon|Juline_Urncaller|say|Welcome! I am Juline Urncaller, I will help to guide you on your path to becoming a powerful enchanter.||||||
30166|akanon|Kaxon_Frennor|say|There are many of our kind that do not understand the necessity of the Dark Reflection. The Eldrich Collective and The Deep Muses seek to root us out and have us put to death or exiled from Ak'Anon. In the Steamfont Mountains a Rogue of the Deep Muses, Jibble Blexnik, has been hunting and killing young members of the Dark Reflection that venture from Ak'Anon. Find this self-righteous rogue and eliminate him. When you have accomplished this task bring me Jibble's Stiletto.||||||
30167|akanon|Kaxon_Frennor|say|At last that haughty rogue has met his end. Take this Dull Dark Reflection Stiletto and sharpen it in a forge with a sharpening stone. It may take several attempts if you are unfamiliar with the process. Once the blade has been sharpened take the sharpened stiletto to Clockwork Smith XIII with a Giant Rat Pelt and he will put the finishing touches on your new weapon.||||||
30169|akanon|Kimble_Nogflop|say|The flask of nitrates I sent for!! As was the deal, here is my Regurgitonic. Give it to whoever may need it and they will surely cough up whatever may be inside them with no harm to them whatsoever.||||||
30170|akanon|Larkon_Theardor|say|Fine work. You have earned the respect of the Library. Here is a small token of our appreciation. We shall have this ground down as soon as we find someone to go to Kaladim.||||||
30171|akanon|Larkon_Theardor|say|Whew! What smells of rotting disease? Oh... It's you. I see you've gathered all the diseased livers. I shall have them incinerated in the scrapyard. The only reason we do this is to keep the Dark Reflection from using these components in their black arts. Take this. I hope you use it wisely. Oh, and... take a bath. You stink!||||||
30172|akanon|Larkon_Theardor|say|Very very good! I can use these in some of our experiments. These tongues are hard to come by and more than a few of our scouts have been turned to stone because of these creatures, but I'm sure you found that out by now, eh?||||||
30173|akanon|Larkon_Theardor|say|The Eldritch Collective thanks you. You have done a great service. We need these special bozinite pestles for use with our eldritch mortars. Here is a scroll from our library. Study it and use it wisely.||||||
30174|akanon|Lewis_Reldnok|say|Ok I will need 4 things to construct this blade. Bring me a Finished Sheet of Metal, a Kobold Backbone, Preserved Rat Pelt and 1 Bottle of Clockwork Oil that was stolen from me from some renegade clockworks not too long ago. Once I have these items I can make you a sword worthy of Brells finest heroes.||||||
30175|akanon|Lewis_Reldnok|say|Welcome to the Abbey of Deep Musing,  $N! Here is a tunic that you may wear to announce the beginning of your training as a Paladin of Brell Serilis! Be warned that the only dangers do not lie without Ak'Anon. There is an evil society that lurks in the deepest recesses and shadows of our magnificent city.||||||
30176|akanon|Lewis_Reldnok|say|Here  $N , I have crafted this for you! May it always strike true!||||||
30177|akanon|Lobal_Postugger|emote|%s laughs. 'Here, take this then!'||||||
30178|akanon|Lyra_Lyrestringer|say|Take this letter to Jakum Webdancer in Kelethin.  You can find him at the bard guild hall.  I am sure he will compensate you for your troubles.||||||
30179|akanon|Manik_Compolten|say|The Asylum of the Mad was formed by the mad gnome, Meldrath. Under his direction, they were trying to build some giant mechanical titan.  We recently sent all of our clockworks into the Steamfont Mountains to destroy their evil cult.||||||
30180|akanon|Manik_Compolten|say|Excellent work! You were born to be a warrior. Here is a little bonus for the good job.||||||
30181|akanon|Manik_Compolten|say|Ah!! I see you had no problem finding all of the C series clockworks. Good work. Here. Take this blackbox. We received it from Clockwork 27C. Take it to Jogl Doobraugh. He is the operator of the only blackbox definer in Ak'Anon. He is out at the windmills checking on their operation.||||||
30182|akanon|Mimtia_Zethkog|say|To assemble Plague Knight Vambraces you will need to obtain two bricks of crude bronze and smelt them in a forge with a Water Flask and this Crude Vambrace Mold. Once that is done combine the Crude Bronze Vambraces with a Low Quality Cat Pelt and two Clockwork Spider Leg Sections in the Mail Assembly Kit.||||||
30183|akanon|Mimtia_Zethkog|say|Hail  $N! You must be one of Garret's new knights. Garret has asked me to help get you outfitted in a suit of armor to protect you from the weapons of our foes.

30184|akanon|Narron_Jenork|say|I will need for you to bring me 1 Clockwork Oil Extract, 1 Minotaur Tibia, 1 Young Ebon Drake Ribcage and 1 Renegade Clockwork Scrapmetal. Return to me after you have gathered this items and I will reward you with your weapon.||||||
30185|akanon|Narron_Jenork|say|Well done, young  $N! Since you have brought me the necessary items, I now present you with this Initiate Watchman's Long Sword. Use it worthily.||||||
30186|akanon|Narron_Jenork|say|Wonderful!! Watchman Dexlin sent word that you would be returning these specimens. I shall see that the Eldritch Collective gets them.  For you there is a reward. Manik has donated a pair of Watchman Boots!!||||||
30187|akanon|Naygog_Mitope|say|Armor? For a warrior? Oh yes. You'll need to speak with Windlebeck for that.||||||
30188|akanon|Naygog_Mitope|say|Well done  $N. Take this Dull Dark Reflection Axe and sharpen it in a forge with a sharpening stone. It may take several attempts if you are unfamiliar with the process. Once the axe has been sharpened take it to Clockwork SmithXIII with a Coyote Pelt and he will put the finishing touches on the weapon.||||||
30189|akanon|Naygog_Mitope|say|This is fabulous news!!  You have done well, young one. Once you are ready for further instruction please let me know, I will guide you through your early and most dangerous days. When you have become more experienced in our art, I will be able to further instruct you on how to progress through your early ranks.||||||
30190|akanon|Rebbie_Romblerum|say|To assemble a Plague Rust Coif you will require two silk thread, ruined ebon drakeling scales, and a rebel clockwork head plate. Once you have the necessary components combine them in your Mail Assembly Kit with this Tattered Cap Pattern.||||||
30191|akanon|Rebbie_Romblerum|say|Hail  $N! You must be one of Kaxon's new trainees. Kaxon has asked me to help get you outfitted in a suit of armor to protect you from the weapons of our foes. I have assembled a kit for you that will allow you to construct the armor pieces once you have gathered the necessary components. The required components vary according to which piece of Plague Rust Mail you are planning on assembling. Do you wish to craft a plague rust coif, a plague rust bracer, plague rust gloves, plague rust boots, plague rust sleeves, plague rust leggings, or a plague rust tunic.||||||
30193|akanon|Rilgor_Plegnog|say|Very nice!! It is perfect! Here take this pen. Have fun with it.||||||
30194|akanon|Sanfyrd_Featherhead|say|Great!! Here you go, my friend. Take this crate and within you shall fill each slot with hair tonic. When all are combined within the crate, return it to me for your wing. I am not sure what the tonic was or where I got it. There is some writing on the crate, but I could not identify it.||||||
30195|akanon|Sanfyrd_Featherhead|say|Grand! We always need more scraps to melt down. Here you are, then... Some coins for supporting Ak'Anon and a salvaged item from the scrapyard.||||||
30196|akanon|Sanfyrd_Featherhead|say|Wow! I see my nephew finally read my list of items. I also see he is not delivering them himself, he is too young to bind himself to the library like that. These items should help me in my research to upgrade the scrapyard. Here let me pen a note to him so you can take it back to him.||||||
30197|akanon|Sanfyrd_Featherhead|say|Huzzah!! You are my friend. Now you can take my old toupee and get it repaired. Just go to Freeport and ask Ping to repair the toupee. Hey!! You know what? He is the guy who sells the hair tonic!! I remember now. Well,.. Get my toupee repaired and I will give you the fairie wing.||||||
30198|akanon|Sanfyrd_Featherhead|say|Double Huzzah!! You are a good friend  $N. Now mayhaps I shall find myself a wife. Here pal, the fairy wing. I hope it can give you a great head of hair. You need it.||||||
30199|akanon|Sanfyrd_Featherhead|say|Good. The citizens of Ak'Anon are safe from those little critters. They may have injured someone that is why they are deactivated. Here is something I found in the scrapyard. I hope you can find a purpose for it.||||||
30200|akanon|Silox_Azrix|despawn|self||||||
30200|akanon|Silox_Azrix|emote|%s looks up at you with a twisted gleam in his eyes. 'Something for me then, eh?' As he looks closer his skin begins to peel and stretch, a bright hot light emanating from his hands gripped around the unicorn horn. 'NOOOO!' The pure cleansing light burns away the gnome without a trace of his existence except for a tiny ball of light which you pick up.||||||
30201|akanon|Tergon_Brenclog|say|So, you have survived. There is no doubt in my mind that you achieved this solely with your own powers. Only a dim one requires the assistance of others. Take this. May it help you in your pursuit of greatness. Further tasks may bring you to that point.||||||
30202|akanon|Tergon_Brenclog|say|You have done well. I did not expect you for weeks. It is good to have my spellbook returned. It was a simple task. Now I have news of a larger matter. It has to do with a defector.||||||
30203|akanon|Tergon_Brenclog|say|The Elemental Grimoire contains the knowledge which will advance your techniques in research. With it you shall learn to research spells and scribe them for your own spellbook.||||||
30204|akanon|Tilkzog_Mournunder|say|To craft a Plague Sorcerer Wristband you require a silk thread, ebon drakeling bile, and a large rat pelt. Once you have the necessary components combine them in your Curing Kit with this Tattered Wristband Pattern.||||||
30205|akanon|Tilkzog_Mournunder|say|It is good to know that one so zealously opposed to the Dark Reflection has been eliminated. Take this Rough Hewn Staff and when you have acquired a Harpies Eye and Pristine Ebon Drakeling Scales take the Staff, Eye, and Scales to Clockwork SmithXIII. The clockwork will put the finishing touches on your new staff.||||||
30206|akanon|Tobon_Starpyre|say|Oh, he is my older brother. Used to be the leader of the Eldritch Collective. Then he founded the Observers, a pretty good piece of work. Went off his rocker a long while back, though. Became obsessed with Innoruuk and the Teir'Dal. Stays away for days at a time, nobody knows where he has been. Mother still worries about him, asked me to keep an eye on him. But he is a grown gnome, and with his mastery of the art, has little to fear in this world or others. But if you are seeking him, I would look outside Ak'Anon, in the Steamfonts. That is where he makes his home these days.||||||
30207|akanon|Tobon_Starpyre|say|Ah.. Welcome, friend! I am Tobon Starpyre, Master Wizard of Library Mechanimagica. This is our tunic - wear it with pride. Study hard, master your skills, and make us proud.||||||

30214|akanon|Welno_Tanlonikan|say|Here is that dagger I promised you  $N!||||||
30215|akanon|Windlebeck_Tobokog|say|To assemble a Plague warrior Breastplate you will need to obtain four bricks of crude bronze and smelt them in a forge with a Water Flask and this Crude Breastplate Mold. Once that is done combine the Crude Bronze Breastplate with a Coyote Pelt, a Rebel Clockwork Chest Plate, and a Rebel Clockwork Back Plate in the Mail Assembly Kit.||||||

30218|akanon|Xalirilan_Zarinokosalio|say|Bracers are a wise idea and will keep you well guarded young Celebus. To create your bracer material you will need to combine 1 Grikbar Kobold Scalps, 1 Plague Rat Tail, 1 Minotaur Scalp and a Cloth Wristband in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material take it to a sewing kit along with this pattern to fashion your very own Bracer of the Collective Initiate.||||||
30219|akanon|Xalirilan_Zarinokosalio|say|I knew you could do it! You have proven yourself worthy of your god and of your Guild! All the highest ranking officials of the Collective will surely hear of your good deeds. Upon studying these pages a bit further it seems it forms a book of incantations that will aid you in furthering your studies. Please take this magical book for I have learned all I can from it. Good luck!||||||

30224|burningwood|Atheling_Plague|yell|Excellent. You show signs of a true Iksar slayer. Too, bad I have already given the skull of the Sister of Scale to another. Perhaps you would like to meet him before he departs. Say hello, Doval.||||||
30225|burningwood|a_sarnak_imitator|say|I see that you have what I was waiting for. Stofo does do excellent work. It seems that you are to start on a long journey. Take this seal and it will guide you on your next step. Seek out the masters of enchantment. In time we will craft the Serpent for you. When you have collected the four parts of the staff, you must combine them in a bundle and return them to me.||||||
30225|burningwood|a_sarnak_imitator|say|Take this seal. You will need to show my seal to the other masters so that they may grant you the tools to complete your next tasks. When you have collected the four parts of the staff, you must combine them in a bundle for me. The other masters can provide the means to bundle them. Good luck and safe travel.||||||
30226|burningwood|a_sarnak_imitator|say|The path you trod was long and hard. Now you are worthy to bear the Serpent. Use it well.||||||
30227|burningwood|Entalon|say|Ha ha ha!! Fool! I have what I need. Now you are granted an audience with a noble sarnak lord, not my master. I am quite sure he shall do away with you. Ha ha ha!!||||||

30228|burningwood|Faelin_Bloodbriar|emote|%s smiles at you, then closes her eyes as she sets the gem 'Nature's Balance' into the crossguard and begins to channel her spirit into the sword. The ground rumbles loudly as she casts. She collapses in exhaustion after a short time. 'Take the blade, and perhaps you can finish this. You must strike at the heart of Innoruuk's lair. Bring a shattered gem and the mithril blade to Xanuusus. Only by weakening Innoruuk's grip over his realm can the balance of the land once again be restored. If we do not meet again,  $N, remember you always have my eternal thanks.'||||||

We must stop Ixiblat Fer while he is still weak or all of Norrath may be set aflame! Please do me one more favor, should I perish to this beast of fire.

30230|burningwood|Slixin_Klex|say|Ssssss. I thought I would never see these. I never thought the symbol of our people would be made whole again. I feel no rest for my sssoul though. My torment still flows as freely as when my peoples first suffered fiery death. I need this not. It is useless to me. Here, you take it. Maybe you can find some good to do with it.||||||
30231|burningwood|Telin_Darkforest|emote|%s looks at you consideringly and then scribbles something quickly on a small, worn paper. 'You seem powerful enough. Perhaps you can help those who seek to protect nature's peace. Take this note. Deliver it only into the hands of Faelin Bloodbriar. Where you will find her, I cannot say. She is a friend of mine and a wanderer. She has been seen from one end of the lands to the other. Seek her out, and quickly.'||||||
30232|burningwood|Telin_Darkforest|emote|%s scratches the coin as he looks at it. 'Faelin sent you to Giz? Surprising. This coin speaks to the outcome of your talk. He would hardly give this bit of metal to a stranger, but that's a story for a different time. So, you say Giz did confirm Innoruuk's involvement, and something about undead minions? Here, take this coin back. Find Arch Druid Althele in the Karanas and show her that. Tell her what we have discussed. She will look kindly on an ally in this matter.'||||||
30233|burningwood|Telin_Darkforest|emote|%s nods as he unbuckles his sword and hands it to you. 'The storm callers are working on containing and fighting against the corruption but they can not hold back the inevitable for long. It is up to us to strike against Innoruuk directly. If we were warriors or paladins we would have a fancy ceremony and plenty of feasting but we're just rangers, without time for pleasantries. The sword you hold in your hands is one of the oldest blades known, even to the eldest. To strike at the darkest heart of evil requires a weapon beyond this, or even ones you may carry at your side. The first task, the first preparation you must make, is the smithing of that blade. Its edge sharpened, its balance made perfect. When you have finished, bring me this sword again.'||||||
30234|burningwood|Telin_Darkforest|emote|%s smiles slowly. 'Now that's fine work,  $N. Just a moment, we have a friend here who can enchant one of the blades. Give her the blade that the ancient smithed.'||||||

30235|butcher|#Kanthuk_Ogrebane|say|I saw Amstaf lower his head and walked away in silence. He was surronded by two beings carrying a torch. I don't know what it meant, but I swear it was so real. When I awoke both Amstaf and Ambreen were gone. Please find Llara and give this pendant to her. This pendant belonged to Amstaf. She too had a vision that night that may clear things up. If she asks where you got it from, mention my name.||||||
30236|butcher|#Kanthuk_Ogrebane|say|Ahh, I see you have spoken to Ryshon. You seem tired from your long journey. Sit with me as I tell you a tale. A tale about a true friend of mine, a great man known as Amstaf Trunolis.||||||
30237|butcher|a_lesser_spirit|say|That is good,  $N. Take this gem. It is a part of us like the clouds to the sky and is a wonderful gift from the grandfather.

Give him the gem and perhaps he will tell you more of the spirits.||||||

It is the Holy Partisan of Underfoot. It is now yours. I believe it still has a couple of charges. Use it wisely as the only cleric able to recharge it was lost amid the lava filled lands of Antonica.||||||
30240|butcher|Durkis_Battlemore|say|What have ye got there, lad? Ack. I thought I would never hear from that crazy old man again. He wants me to give you a pair o' me gauntlets. I suppose I kin do that. Here you are,  $N . Wear them in good health.||||||
30241|butcher|Guard_Haldin|say|Eh, strapling? Ye got this from me ol' partner? Huh. Aye, I know what it means but ye're not hearin'. Here, take this. It was his but he's not needin' it now.||||||
30242|butcher|Siltria_Marwind|say|Take this letter to Jakum Webdancer in Kelethin.  You can find him at the bard guild hall.  I am sure he will compensate you for your troubles.||||||
30243|butcher|Vedico_Windwisper|emote|%s reaches into her pack and pulls out a note. 'Do you think you could deliver this to my gnome friend Forpar? I have not spoken to him in a while and unfortunatly I will be unable to make the trip to visit him. If you are looking to have an instrument made he is the man to ask.'||||||
30243|butcher|Vedico_Windwisper|say|Where did you find this? I thought the cyclops took it. I am in your debt,  $N. This horn has always been special to me.||||||
30244|butcher|Walnan|say|The arcane art of Summoning is derived from the power of the elements which surround us. Continue your journey across the Ocean of Tears. In a dark fortress, you should find Akksstaf lurking about. Be wary, but tell him that you seek Magi'kot. Hurry now  $N, you do not wish to miss the ship!||||||
30245|cabeast|#Prime_Patriarch_Vuzx|say|Well done young patriarch! I believe you are ready to face larger nuisances that prowl outside our city walls. Head out to the Field of Bone and return to me bearing three Spiderling Silks and a Scarab Carapace.||||||
30246|cabeast|#Prime_Patriarch_Vuzx|say|You have overcome sturdy yet unintelligent creatures that plague our kind. You are now ready to face our foes that are more intelligent than the insects you have defeated. We have many foes possessing a degree of intelligence, the least of these foes being the tribes of goblins that inhabit our Empires lands. Even now there are goblin watchers prowling just outside our gates. Locate four of these watchers, slay them and return to me with their Goblin Watcher Signal Torches.||||||
30247|cabeast|#Prime_Patriarch_Vuzx|say|You have triumphed over the watchers, young patriarch, but they are among the weakest of our sentient foes. Mere fodder sent to warn to the more powerful goblins of an opportunity to strike. It is time for you to face the Goblin Hunters, and learn of our enemies the Sarnak, a species of dragonmen that once served the Iksar Empires of old. Journey to the wilderness and return with two Goblin Hunter Javelins and two Sarnak Broodling Fangs.||||||
30248|cabeast|#Prime_Patriarch_Vuzx|say|Now you will learn of another enemy of the Legion of Cabilis, the frogloks. The frogloks from the froglok settlement of Krup often sent their tuk warriors to prey on unsuspecting Iksar citizens that ventures outside the gates of Cabilis. Find these Froglok Tuk Warriors and return with four of their buckler shields.||||||
30249|cabeast|#Prime_Patriarch_Vuzx|say|Congratulations young Patriarch, you have learned all that I can teach you at this time. You must venture forth now on your own and fulfill the fate that has been glimpsed by the Hierophants before your hatching.||||||
30250|cabeast|#Prime_Patriarch_Vuzx|say|The Hierophants have sensed that your spirit is strong with obedience inspiring fear! You must learn to harness your powers over the scaled wolves! Wear this tunic so that the Legion of Cabilis will recognize you as a Scaled Spiritist.||||||
30251|cabeast|an_Iksar_crusader|emote|%s slings his pack on his back and locks his sheath. 'Very well. I shall follow shortly. You must depart on your own. Go to the plains of the old skinless outpost. Beware, they have returned and patrol the hillside. Keep an eye on the gates of the outpost. I will be disguised within their ranks, I shall kneel as a sign. Give me this coin as your token.'||||||
30252|cabeast|Arch_Duke_Xog|say|Welcome into our brotherhood. Know you that our way is the way of pain. Do as we say and you shall climb the rungs of knighthood. Listen well to the Lords of Pain within this temple and follow the words of the hierophants, for Cazic-Thule speaks to us through them. Take this khukri. It is the chosen weapon of the Crusaders and can deliver great pain unto our foes. Go now and learn our ways. Seek out Lord Gikzic.||||||
30253|cabeast|Arch_Duke_Xog|say|A legible tome of the scrolls of Vok Na Zov! What a find this is!! May the unholy curses of Cazic flow through you. Please accept the weapon of a Lord of Pain. To abandon it is to abandon our ways and earn yourself the hatred of our order.||||||
30254|cabeast|Arch_Duke_Xog|emote|%s takes the note and glances at it briefly then lets out a heavy sigh and stares out over the city for several minutes. Finally he says quietly, 'Several months ago we lost contact with one of our crusaders. His name is, or was, Geanik. The last we heard from him he was furthering our cause against the loathsome Goblins that reside in Warsliks Wood. Just recently we were visited by a strange Iksar.'||||||
30255|cabeast|Arch_Duke_Xog|say|Thanks for resolving this issue. Here is your reward||||||
30256|cabeast|Arch_Duke_Xog|emote|%s takes the note without even a glance in your direction and begins reading. After a long silence, he lets his arms drop to his sides and says quietly, 'We kill,  $N. That is our job, our duty in life. Our targets are chosen for us. We merely listen. Right now I am being told there is a traitor not far from here, near the ocean. Go to him and end his life. Bring me his head, and two star rubies. As you do this, try hard to listen to our Lord's instruction. If you hear even a whisper, you will know more righteousness than most of this city.'||||||
30257|cabeast|Arch_Duke_Xog|say|Well done,  $N.||||||
30258|cabeast|Arch_Duke_Xog|emote|%s takes the icon and stares at it. His face twists into a look of disdain and he suddenly throws the icon off the balcony. It lands in the water some distance away. Without even a glance at you he says in disgust, 'You're an idiot,  $N. You fit your profession well. Leave my sight.'||||||
30259|cabeast|a_froglok_slave|despawn|self||||||
30259|cabeast|a_froglok_slave|emote|%s takes the vial, hands shaking as he looks upon you fearfully. It then gulps down what it assumes to be a beverage. After a moment, it clutches at its throat and tries to scream, only able to muster a weak gurgle as its flesh is reduced to liquid. In seconds all that is left is a puddle of greenish goo which you quickly collect.||||||
30260|cabeast|Clerk_Doval|say|I heard the dragon called Trakanon swallowed them up and their skulls now lie within the belly of that vile beast.  Of course, that could be just babble.  One hundred gold coins may give you the tink.||||||
30261|cabeast|Clerk_Doval|say|Thank you so much. I am so glad I did not have to deal with such a rowdy band of troopers as these. Please take some coin and perhaps a book from my personal library.||||||
30262|cabeast|Crusader_Zixo|emote|%s roars at you, heat pouring into his dead eyes. 'Do you know what this means, wretch? I will give you one chance to prevent your floating near my feet. Take this tome and go speak to the Toilmaster. MOVE, while you still have breath.||||||
30263|cabeast|Crusader_Zixo|emote|%s takes the bag and tome from you and in return gives you the item that you have been thinking of all of this time. 'Lucky you. You have earned a second chance. Praise Cazic-Thule!'||||||
30264|cabeast|Drill_Master_Dal|emote|%s hands you a shimmering black piece of armor which smells quite horrid. You find it hard to keep it from slithering out of your hand. 'Here is the armor the tailors have been working on for the legion. You may test it for us. Keep up your fine work and I may have other pieces available for you to test.'||||||
30265|cabeast|Drill_Master_Dal|say|Fantastic work, Partisan  $N. Here is your reward. You may continue to perform this task as the baron has found it aids in our defense. I shall always pay for a good day's work. Just let me know if you are still ready for the task. As for the curskin shield, you may only have one. Perhaps soon you will prove yourself a formidable fighter and you can earn a militia pike from Drill Master Vygan.||||||
30266|cabeast|Drill_Master_Kyg|say|Kyg knew you could do it. You will make a fine legionnaire some day but, for now, you shall be a footman. Take the footman pike head plans. Forge the footman's pike. Do so, and then you may have an audience with the War Baron on the subject of his Memory of Sebilis.||||||
30267|cabeast|Drill_Master_Vygan|say|I see they have begun to draft younger broodlings? Hmmph!! No matter. We Drill Masters shall make a warrior of you. Here is your partisan's pike and some coin as your wages. Be sure that you begin your training in blacksmithing and report to the other Drill Masters for any tasks they may have for you. Let them know you are a partisan of Cabilis. Perhaps soon you shall be rewarded the militia pike.||||||
30268|cabeast|Drill_Master_Vygan|say|You have perfomed just as expected. I bestow upon you the rank of militiaman. Here is your new pike. Past this, you shall require the geozite tool to upgrade your future pikes and mancatchers. We see much promise in you, militiaman. Go forth to serve the realm.||||||
30269|cabeast|Drill_Master_Vygan|say|You are a true warrior of Cabilis. You obviously are aware that in order to upgrade your pike you shall need a geozite tool. Take this note to the Lord of the outer gates. He desires a young warrior for a small task. Do this and he is instructed to reward you with the tool.||||||
30270|cabeast|Grand_Master_Glox|emote|%s breaks his meditation and quickly grabs your forearms. You feel the raw power in his heavily callused hands. Out of nowhere, his tail sweeps forward and places a shackle upon your wrist. He then points south towards Master Bain and returns to his meditation.||||||
30271|cabeast|Grand_Master_Glox|emote|%s sits whispering incoherently for a long moment before even regarding the note you dropped in front of him. The Grand Master suddenly snatches up the note from Xlixinar, removes a small charcoal marker from a belt pouch, and scrawls some intructions upon it. He drops the note immediately after finishing and resumes his meditation without a word.||||||
30272|cabeast|Grand_Master_Glox|emote|%s nods slightly||||||
30273|cabeast|Grype|emote|%s nearly faints. His eyes begin to tear up. 'Oh my sweet stein of sloshing! This is the great treasure. A shiny piece of broken metal! Ha! You never win when you deal with a Blue Talon!||||||
30274|cabeast|Grype|emote|%s swallows the whole bottle in one gulp. 'Here, go buy yourself a brain. What?!! You expecting something? How about this.. <BUUURRRPPPP!!> Thanks for helping me get through my dry spell, croak!! Never mess with a Blue Talon!!||||||
30275|cabeast|Half_Elf_Maiden|say|Oh! thank you! I did not expect to hear of my family ever again. This seal should grant me protection out of the city if I am careful. Please take this note to my father and let him know I am safe!||||||
30276|cabeast|Hierophant_Dexl|emote|%s goes into a trance and speaks with the voice of an ancient. 'You have returned the skulls of the Sisters of Scale. For this you shall be rewarded. Take this hierophant's weapon. May you use it to smite the foes of our people.' Dexl comes out of the trance. 'What?!! Whew. Hey!! Where is my cudgel?||||||
30277|cabeast|Hierophant_Granix|emote|%s peers at the skull intently. 'There is strange magic in this skull  $N, whatever necromancer animated this skeleton was a powerful warlock indeed. I sense the power of several ancients in this relic. Take this skull to Oracle Qulin in the field of bone, he may be able to perform the ritual which will free this ancient's spirit from the mortal realm.'||||||
30278|cabeast|Hierophant_Granix|say|It is as I feared, the mark of the warlock has surely driven these ancient spirits mad. We can not allow these spirits to roam free in our world  $N. Take this case and place the glowing skulls of other ancients inside of it. Return it to me with your Cudgel of the Heirophant so that we may remove these cursed spirits from our world forcefully.||||||
30279|cabeast|Hierophant_Granix|say|You have done well  $N. Perhaps you can help clear these troubling dreams from my tired aging mind. Commune with the spirits of our Ancestors and learn from them. Never forget that the ultimate power comes from knowledge. The ancients are privy to much knowledge that mortals will never see. Should you be granted enlightenment from our ancestors, share your knowledge with me so that we may use this knowledge for the benefit of our brethren. I will continue to study the dreams that cloud my mind.||||||
30280|cabeast|Hierophant_Oxyn|emote|%s takes the note and begins to howl into the air! 'The visions are true! The new prophecy begins today, Crusader,' the mystic growls with pleasure. He quickly turns and takes a bottle of murky liquid from one of his potion bags and hands it to you. 'Take this and keep it safe. Our visions have told of this day. We have been able to learn of the metal of prophecy. This liquid will help us to locate its true resting place!||||||
30281|cabeast|Hierophant_Oxyn|emote|%s holds the ore in his hands and begins to chant. His eyes go white as he raises the chunk of ore above his head. He lowers his arms and shakes his head for a moment. His eyes return to their normal state as they focus on you. The shaman hands you the ore and says, 'Seek out the creator of Rile's blade. He is still on this plane. I have felt his torment. Take this note to Librarian Zimor. He learned a great deal from the tome and can instruct you further.'||||||
30282|cabeast|Hierophant_Oxyn|say|We appreciate your service. Take a few copper for your deed as well as some of our cursed waters. They will provide you with nourishment. As for future tasks, we are searching for a few lost skulls and i am sure you are searching for your iron cudgel of the clairvoyant And i also hear that the furscales are in need of some broodlings to do some manual labor. Tell them Oxyn sent you.||||||
30283|cabeast|Hierophant_Oxyn|say|Excellent! You have proved yourself worthy to wield the iron cudgel of the clairvoyant. As a clairvoyant I feel I can trust you, so I will tell you that the issue of the missing skulls is a much larger problem than last stated.||||||
30284|cabeast|Hierophant_Oxyn|say|We are in your debt, $N . You are truly one who shall collect all the lost ancient skulls. Take your weapon. Go to Hierophant Zand and he shall guide you further. Tell him you are the chosen saviour.||||||
30285|cabeast|Hierophant_Zand|say|What?! I have read of them, but that is all I know of the legendary mystic, err, mystics... whatever! Where their remains rest is a mystery, but those filthy goblins always seem to get ahold of things that are lost, all that infernal digging you see.||||||
30286|cabeast|Hierophant_Zand|emote|%s takes the bag and tome from you and in return gives you the item that you have been thinking of all of this time. 'Lucky you. You have earned a second chance. Praise Cazic-Thule!'||||||
30287|cabeast|Hierophant_Zand|say|Fine work! I hope for your sake, you did not purchase it from a brave adventurer. Take this note to the one for whom it is written. This lizard has knowledge of a large number of skulls.||||||
30288|cabeast|Hierophant_Zand|emote|%s closes his eyes and reopens them. They have no pupils. He speaks and you hear his voice echo. 'We are Di Nozok. You have earned the weapon of a channeler. We hope to fill your thoughts with ours some day. Go and seek out Dexl. We send you to him. Farewell , Channeler of Cabilis.||||||
30289|cabeast|Klok_Ephmir|emote|%s turns pale at the mention of the Outlander. 'The Outlander!! That is what the lizards in the Tink N' Babble have dubbed him!! He is tall and strong. Get close enough and he will kill you on sight!! I think he could even defeat the likes of Bruiser Noz!! I spotted him near the edge of the swamps. He was headed toward the fields of Firiona.'||||||
30290|cabeast|Klok_Ephmir|emote|%s takes the disk and attaches it to an odd device powered by a foot pedal. He takes a froglok leg and begins to slice it as chunks of gristle flies into your face. When he is done he hands you some thin sliced froglok. 'There you are. Run along.'||||||
30291|cabeast|Klok_Mugruk|say|Good. You take thisss pack and fill it all with scaled curskins. Only the pupsss and cubs of the scaled wolves shall do. They are not much for one sssuch as you. Combine all those ssskins and return the full curskin pack and I shall reward you with any available piece of curskin armor and a sssmall amount of coin. Mossst important is that you shall be proving your allegiance to all of Cabilisss.||||||
30292|cabeast|Klok_Mugruk|say|You are a good servant and a fine citizen. I have this piece of curscale armor available, but if it is not enough then perhaps I shall have another piece available if you were to perform the small service again.||||||
30293|cabeast|Klok_Mugruk|say|I see you have done some hunting, young broodling. I shall prepare these husks later, as for now you can have this training bag husk I have already prepared. You will require a sewing kit, but I am sure you already have one. You will next have to seek out granite pebbles.  Where you shall find them in Cabilis is unknown to me. When you obtain no less than three piles of granite pebbles then you can tailor a monk training bag for your caste. Good luck!||||||
30294|cabeast|Klok_Unlar|emote|%s breaks open the crust of the pie. 'Wait! What is this? A device of some kind? It looks kind of like some sort of lockpick. BUGRIN!! Get in here and answer some questions at once!!||||||
30294|cabeast|Klok_Unlar|spawnunique|106302|120|563|4|0||
30295|cabeast|Librarian_Zimor|emote|%s looks disturbed as he examines the book. His hands tremble as he mouths the words on the ancient parchment pages. 'This book may alter the reality you see before you, 'the scholar says as he continues to read the tome. 'The information that has been waiting in this book may have been brought to us by your hand, but your fate has obviously been chosen by our Lord. Our mystics have conveyed a new vision to us in this most recent season. Please take this note to Hierophant Oxyn, while I continue to translate this tome.' The Librarian hands you a note and turns his attention back to the book.||||||
30296|cabeast|Librarian_Zimor|say|I am very glad you have returned. Your discovery of the tynnonium is extraordinary! This Sarnak tome has been an incredible source of information. It appears that they have been studying the Greenmist for some time. I'm sure they sought it as nothing more than a trinket to be collected. Their shortsightedness will be their eventual undoing. I have compiled a book of notes that will aid you in your quest for the Greenmist. Please take care to keep this information out of the grasp of our enemies.||||||
30297|cabeast|Lord_Gikzic|say|You have learned to behead your opponents with great precision. Take the khukri of the knave. It shall prove most formidable in combat when wielded by a young crusader. You may now assist us with a greater concern than your training.||||||
30298|cabeast|Lord_Gikzic|say|You have done as instructed. You are wise to hand this tome to me. It could bring you nothing more than insanity. As your reward, you shall have the squire's khukri. Soon you shall wield the knight's khukri, but that is for another Lord of Pain to decide.||||||
30299|cabeast|Lord_Korzin|say|Excellent work! You are no squire. You are now a knight of the crusaders. Your next step shall be zealot. And every zealot wields a magical khukri.||||||
30300|cabeast|Lord_Qyzar|say|At last!! The Chalp diagram. I shall see that the emperor gets this at once. You have proven yourself more than just a mere knight, you are a zealot. Being new to the temple we have need of you in a matter of betrayal.||||||
30301|cabeast|Lord_Qyzar|say|Congratulations! You are now a true crusader, but there is no time for celebration. We have lost two of our operatives. Crusaders Golin and Fodcod were dispatched to seek out an ancient artifact, the visceral dagger. Where they have gone, I do not know. They have been gone far too long. Find them and return the dagger to me with your crusader khukri and you shall be a hero.||||||
30302|cabeast|Lord_Qyzar|emote|%s gazes in astonishment at the dagger. 'Ahhh!! You have brought the sacred visceral dagger back to the Temple of Terror. Let all be aware that the great  $N has returned to Cabilis a hero!! You now wield the weapon of a hero. Hail,  $N, hero of the Crusaders of Greenmist.||||||
30303|cabeast|Master_Bain|say|Seeking Master Rinmark? He has left the Court of Pain. Gone to focus his thoughts on the elements of wind and thunder. I believe he was headed toward the Overthere. That was the last I heard of his trek.||||||
30304|cabeast|Master_Bain|emote|%s smiles at your dedication to Cazic Thule and hands you a small gem.||||||
30305|cabeast|Master_Bain|emote|%s smiles at your dedication to Cazic Thule and hands you a small gem.||||||
30306|cabeast|Master_Bain|say|We thank you, young $C. In exchange for your prompt service, please accept this piece of training armor. Please continue with your training.||||||
30307|cabeast|Master_Niska|emote|%s removes a crudley hewn shackle. 'This is yours. It is one of the keys to the third rung. I see that you are truely a great monk and have studied your disciplines well. I have need of one as you. I have heard of troubles with an outlander.'||||||
30308|cabeast|Master_Niska|say|Very good!! Here is your Shackle of Copper. The Emperor shall be pleased that I, Mistress Niska, have slain the outlander. Do you have some time? I need someone to be my personal courier. Will you?||||||
30309|cabeast|Master_Niska|emote|%s smiles at your dedication to Cazic Thule and hands you a small gem.||||||
30310|cabeast|Master_Niska|emote|%s smiles at your dedication to Cazic Thule and hands you a small gem.||||||
30311|cabeast|Master_Niska|say|You have earned your replacement Shackle of Dust, do take better care of it.||||||
30312|cabeast|Master_Raska|say|You have succeeded, young  $N! You have proven yourself a skilled monk. You will now wear the shackle of clay. You will now be required to increase your intensity of training in hopes that you may soon be able to earn your shackle of stone.||||||
30313|cabeast|Master_Raska|say|You have done supremely,  $N. You have earned your shackle of stone. Mistress Niska will now help you on your way to earning the shackle of rock. May the elements guide you to the next rung.||||||
30314|cabeast|Master_Raska|emote|%s smiles at your dedication to Cazic Thule and hands you a small gem.||||||
30315|cabeast|Master_Raska|emote|%s smiles at your dedication to Cazic Thule and hands you a small gem.||||||
30316|cabeast|Master_Raska|say|This is all that was ever found of Gandan Tailfist. I wish you luck in your quest. May you fare better than he did.||||||
30317|cabeast|Prime_Hierophant_Vek|say|Welcome, young petitioner. You have been summoned to this temple to join with the Scaled Mystics. Ours is the way of pain and suffering. Here is the weapon of a petitioner. Through you the power of our ancestors shall flow. As your wisdom grows, so shall your power. Someday you may be a vessel for the supreme might of the ancients. Seek knowldege within this temple. The hierophants are here to guide you.||||||
30318|cabeast|Prime_Hierophant_Vek|emote|%s smiles at your dedication to Cazic Thule and hands you a small gem.||||||
30319|cabeast|Prime_Hierophant_Vek|emote|%s smiles at your dedication to Cazic Thule and hands you a small gem.||||||
30320|cabeast|Prime_Hierophant_Vek|emote|%s takes the note without even a glance in your direction and begins reading. After a long silence, he lets his arms drop to his sides and says quietly, 'We kill,  $N. That is our job, our duty in life. Our targets are chosen for us. We merely listen. Right now I am being told there is a traitor right here in our city. You must make this potion made of Spine Poison Extract and Willow Moss.  You must give this to one of our slave and bring me the goo from it along with two Fire Emeralds. As you do this, try hard to listen to our Lord's instruction. If you hear even a whisper, you will know more righteousness than most of this city.'||||||
30321|cabeast|Prime_Hierophant_Vek|emote|%s stares down at the note, confused, until he recognizes the writing and gasps in shock! 'You spoke to the Brothers? You, a simple Legionnaire? Well, no matter, you are here to test your virtue of sacrifice and we will take pleasure in it as we have for generations even before the Fallen Brothers. One of our greatest allies in pain is disease. In the woods outside our fair city is a small tribe of goblins. There is a certain goblin famed for his unique weapon. Take this knife and use it to cut this from the goblin. Then return his weapon, the knife, a sapphire, and an opal to me.'||||||
30322|cabeast|Prime_Hierophant_Vek|say|Well done||||||
30323|cabeast|Prime_Hierophant_Vek|say|Well done||||||
30324|cabeast|Sarth_Scarscale|say|Well done!  Here is the item we agreed upon.  May Cazic's glorious curses flow through you!||||||

30335|cabeast|Sirtha_Scarscale|say|Well done! Here is the item we agreed upon. May Cazic's glorious curses flow through you!||||||
30336|cabeast|Squire_Gristle|emote|%s shakes his head and growls. 'That is not good, broodling... Not good at all. You will need to take this note and seek out the Toilmaster immediately. Read it on the way and hope that your incompetence can be overcome. We do have a pit for you, should this prove to be impossible.||||||
30337|cabeast|Squire_Gristle|emote|%s takes the bag and tome from you and in return gives you the item that you have been thinking of all of this time. Lucky, you... you have earned a second chance. Praise Cazic-Thule!||||||
30338|cabeast|The_Toilmaster|say|Sss...  All hail Emperor Vekin.  He shall restore the glory of the Iksar Empire.  He shall reclaim Old Sebilis and slay Trakanon!  Hail the mighty Emperor Vekin or lose thy head!||||||
30339|cabeast|The_Toilmaster|say|A deal is a deal. Here is one pile of granite pebbles. I hope you need more because I know there are more escaped froglok slaves.||||||
30340|cabeast|The_Toilmaster|emote|%s looks at the tome and speaks to you, scowling, 'Very well Broodling, I have a task for you. I should make you work at the feet of my Froglok Slaves, crushing granite, but the lore of the Brood has a specific rite for this situation. Take this book and learn the will of Cazic-Thule. Read it and ask me any questions that you may have before you start your penance. It would be a shame for you to fail at this task as well... though I wouldn't mind destroying you.||||||
30341|cabeast|Trooper_Fryp|emote|%s signs the order and hands it back to you. 'Well... At least I now have this fancy writing quill.'||||||
30342|cabeast|Trooper_Nishnish|emote|%s grabs the barracuda teeth and attaches them to a necklace. 'Good. Now this barracuda charm shall keep me safe from slipping into the waters and becoming a feast for the barracuda. And you, take this legion order and be gone.'||||||
30343|cabeast|Trooper_Shestar|emote|%s quickly inserts the scales into a half finished coif and hands you the coif. 'I am afraid that is not enough and I cannot possibly complete the task while on duty. You must go and find an additional three Scaled Wolf Scales and take them, along with the Unfinished Coif, to the nearest forge and complete the smithing yourself. I hope you are a blacksmith.'||||||

30346|cabeast|War_Baron_Eator|emote|%s gulps down a wad of phlegm. 'My memory has returned!  $N! You are no footman. I grant you the rank of soldier. Go and forge your weapon. Do not return to me until you become a brave trooper of the empire.'||||||
30347|cabeast|War_Baron_Eator|emote|%s takes away your pike and hands you plans not for a pike head, but for the crown of another polearm. 'It is time to wield the weapon of a true warrior of the legion. You have done well, Legionnaire  $N!'||||||
30348|cabeast|Zazlan_Furscale|say|You have succeeded! Take this as payment and begin getting the next bundle.  The more supplies we have the faster we can rebuild||||||

30353|cabwest|a_mortician|say|The tower is the laboratory of the secluded Brood of Kotiz.  We supply them with many slaves for their dark experiments and rituals.  Its dark halls smell of rotted flesh from a multitude of creatures, even our own.  It is said there is an entire chamber filled with the blood of a million.  This is no place for a weak stomach.  And the Brood does not welcome visitors.||||||
30354|cabwest|Harbinger_Glosk|say|Another apprentice has reached rebirth. You now have become one with the Brood of Kotiz. We study the ancient writing of Kotiz. Through his writing we have found the power of the dark circles. Listen well to the scholars within this tower and seek the Keepers Grotto for knowledge of our spells. This drape shall be the sign to all Iksar that you walk with the Brood. Now go speak with Xydoz.||||||
30355|cabwest|Harbinger_Glosk|emote|%s presents to you a glowing skullcap. 'This is the treasured cap of the sorcerers of this tower. Let all gaze upon you in awe. You are what others aspire to be. I look forward to reading of your adventures, Sorceror  $N.'||||||
30356|cabwest|Harbinger_Glosk|say|You have done well in doing what I have asked. To make a gem of reflection you will need some Mt Death mineral salts, a green goblin skin, spiroc bone dust, essence of rathe, blue slumber fungus, and a vial of pure essence. Combine all of these in this container and you will have what it is you seek.||||||
30357|cabwest|Harbinger_Glosk|emote|%s hisses and says venomously, 'And I am disturbed yet again. I hope for your sake it is important.'||||||
30357|cabwest|Harbinger_Glosk|emote|The gaunt necromancer looks down at the paper in his hands and after reading a few lines gasps, then falls into a violent coughing fit. After recovering he takes a deep breath, puffs his chest out and hands the paper back to you. With his head held high, he says in a raspy voice, 'Show this to Rixiz. He will test you.'||||||
30358|cabwest|Harbinger_Glosk|emote|%s snatches the note out of your hands, obviously irritated. After reading a few lines, he glances up at you, his brow furrowed, then looks down again to continue reading. When he's finished, he hands the note back to you and takes a deep breath, shuddering slightly. He then says, 'Xydoz. Take this to Xydoz. He will test you.'||||||
30358|cabwest|Harbinger_Glosk|emote|%s watches you carefully as you leave.||||||
30359|cabwest|Jondin|say|I should tell you. I do not need the bone chips.  I need bone granite powder.  In order to get it. you must find some granite pebbles and then three piles of bone chips from decaying skeletons.  After you gather the items you will have to use your skill in alchemy to combine the items and create bone granite powder.  The powder is what I need.||||||
30360|cabwest|Keeper_Bile|emote|%s tosses the items into a nearby box and reaches into a sack at his feet. He hands you your reward. 'This spell is going to need some major testing. I can always use more of the same components.'||||||
30361|cabwest|Keeper_Pain|emote|%s begins jumping for joy. 'Yoohoo!! My wand!! Thank you. You must be some powerful adventurer. You can help me collect a few components. Fill this chest with a frost crystal, a cockatrice egg, a giant hornet egg and a plains pebble. Return the full chest to me and I shall offer you a spell I recently researched.||||||
30362|cabwest|Keeper_Pain|say|Yes this is exactly what I wanted. Here is your spell.||||||
30363|cabwest|Keeper_Rott|say|Oh, great necromancer, how can I repay you?!! I know. Here is a spell I recently researched. It should help you increase the strength of a summoned pet. Learn it well.||||||
30364|cabwest|Marthor|say|Ha! How did you know my favorite drink? Master Rinmark told you? That crazy old monk spends his days sitting on that mountain in Timorous Deep doesn't he? And they call me a drunkard! Anyhow, I bet he told you about the Whistling Fists. I have never seen them myself, and have only heard legend passed down by Master Tynn.||||||
30365|cabwest|Marthor|say|You earned the Tynnonium Shackle? I am sure you wish to seek the fists of lore. Gandan has come as close as anyone, you would have to talk to him. Last I heard his expedition has taken him to the Howling Stones.||||||
30366|cabwest|Master_Kyvix|say|I need the foot and stem of my candlestick. The Stem comes from Sarnaks. The foot has been stolen by Grype, in East Cabilis.||||||
30367|cabwest|Master_Kyvix|say|you have taken far too long!! Already another apprentice has performed this task. You will still be rewarded with the Dark Binder skullcap, but now you must aid in a true mission.||||||
30368|cabwest|Master_Kyvix|say|I did not expect you to return. You have made me lose a bet with one of the other scholars. Seeing as you have delivered the tome, I shall not harm you, but rather welcome you into the rank of occultist. Now go see Keeper Rott and tell him you are the chosen occultist||||||
30369|cabwest|Master_Kyvix|emote|%s grabs the candle parts and puts them in an odd pouch, then takes your cap which disintegrates in his palm. He hands you another cap. 'Welcome, Revenant  $N. You have done well. The Harbinger awaits you. He seeks a new revenant.'||||||
30370|cabwest|Master_Rixiz|say|Embalming fluid is created through brewing, but do not drink it!! You can learn about the process of brewing on our grounds.||||||
30371|cabwest|Master_Rixiz|say|You have done well. Here is your final apprentice skullcap.||||||
30372|cabwest|Master_Rixiz|emote|%s takes the note and after reading a few lines opens his eyes wide in astonishment. He looks up at you and stares at you a while before he says,||||||
30372|cabwest|Master_Rixiz|say|You spoke to the Brothers? A common soldier such as yourself interested in silly stories to frighten broodlings? Fine, then. You shall know confidence, if you live. If you have the strength to stride into a lair, go before the owner, and kill that thing in its own home, you will acquire a small part of the virtue we as necromancers must master to ply our art. In the Frontier Mountains lives a unit of the troublesome burynai. Invade their home and destroy their leader. Bring me proof and two fire emeralds.||||||
30373|cabwest|Master_Rixiz|say|Well done, here is your reference.||||||
30374|cabwest|Master_Xydoz|say|Good work, my young apprentice. You will make a fine addition to our ranks. Here is your first apprentice skullcap. Wear it as a sign of our circle. Do not lose it. Someday you shall wear a necromancer skullcap, but next shall come the second rank skullcap.||||||
30375|cabwest|Master_Xydoz|say|A job well done, apprentice  $N. Your fine service shall earn you the second circle apprentice skullcap. I would advise you to forget this tapestry, it is nothing more than an ancient rug of no importance.||||||
30376|cabwest|Master_Xydoz|emote|%s snatches the paper from your hand and hisses in anger. Without even looking at the paper he growls||||||
30376|cabwest|Master_Xydoz|say|WHAT?! What is this tra... He stares down at the paper, mouth hanging open wide in disbelief. He finally continues, saying, Very well, then. If you wish to know confidence I have a task for you. Our hated enemies, the sarnak, have a tome we have sought to return to our libraries for centuries. At this point, we believe it to be found in a small fortress they maintain near the Great Lake. One of their scholars will most likely have it on their person. Bring it to me along with two star rubies.||||||
30377|cabwest|Master_Xydoz|say|Well done||||||
30378|cabwest|Nihilist_Zeegarn|say|What is this?' The Nihilist barks in disbelief. 'You have lost your drape? This is unacceptable! Take this note and report to the Toilmaster at once. Read it on the way and praise Cazic-Thule for any mercy that you may be granted!||||||
30379|cabwest|Nihilist_Zeegarn|emote|%s takes the bag and tome from you and in return gives you the item that you have been thinking of all of this time.'Lucky you. You have earned a second chance. Praise Cazic-Thule!'||||||
30380|cabwest|Trooper_Neozite|emote|%s begins to weep. 'My favorite ale! Oh what a happy day! Please take this for your troubles.||||||

30383|cauldron|#Llara|say|Ruathey is known for her ability to look into people's souls and find truth. Though I wasn't able to find Amstaf, I was able to recover his sword. I believe that by having his sword I am closer to finding him. Take this note to Ruathey and tell her that I sent you.||||||
30384|cauldron|#Llara|say|Oh my, this belongs to Amstaf! Where did you get it?||||||
30386|cauldron|Conium_Darkblade|say|Take the giant wasp venom. Good or evil it is not. That is up to you.||||||
30387|cauldron|Conium_Darkblade|say|So Lon has sworn allegiance to a temple. What a fool, but he is a skilled fool. My word is my bond and if he asks for the gem, then so be it. Unfortunately I traded it for a much-needed axe. It was in the middle of a dungeon and... well, that is a long story. If you want to get the gem, take this axe back to the one who once owned it.||||||
30388|cauldron|Ghilanbiddle_Nylwadil|say|Biggily boo, biggily borc.. Raise that stinky orc!! Bamm!! Okay!! It's done.

30392|charasis|Gandan_Tailfist|emote|%s places a foul smelling book in your hands and speaks to you slowly. 'Take this rotting book given to me by lord Cazic Thule himself, I was given another but it has been lost. The search for the fists will be the end of me. If you are a monk of the final rung show me your Shackle of Tynnonium and I will share with you what I have found.||||||

He hurls the components above his head where they remain suspended in midair. They hover in place while he chants the words of an ancient spell.

30451|crushbone|a_dwarven_smith|say|Outstanding! If you can kill the taskmaster, you might prove useful in recovering the items the orcs took from me when they caught me out in the Faydarks. Interested in helping me out?||||||

30477|eastkarana|Ganelorn_Oast|say|Ah, what do we have here? A letter? Hmm? Scented with a familiar fragrance too. You must have gotten this from Lily. I do wish I had more time to spend with her, for she is a very sweet girl. If she trusts you to deliver such a letter, I must ask you to do me a favor for me. Please take these eggs. They are a very rare species of albino rattlesnakes which were thought to have been extinct due to poachers who eat them as a delicacy and griffins which prey on them. If these eggs hatch there is hope for the species. I need you to deliver them to my master, Kithicor.||||||
30478|eastkarana|Ganelorn_Oast|say|This does speak highly of you, my friend, an award from Kithicor does not come easy. But I must see more of your skills before I can consider teaching you. Lily's brother Devin is my current pupil - I need you to gather some equipment for me so I can properly train him. I require the following items of you - a smoldering sash, an adamantine ring and a blade forged of electrum. I also need a favor. Take this credit slip to Aanina Rockfinder. She is a merchant from whom I purchased a gift for Lily it should be ready by now.||||||

30487|eastkarana|Tenal_Redblade|say|So, you know my brother Kargek. He is weak and does not believe the legend that our family was chosen by Rallos Zek to bear the great scabbard. Yet he still holds it. Very well, I shall give you the first test since my 'dear' brother seems to have forgotten it. Travel to the fortress where the children of Rallos were first cursed by the Rathe and bring me the heart of one of the goblins who have made it their new home. Do not return without the heart of your foe and this war totem.||||||
30488|eastkarana|Tenal_Redblade|say|Very good, you have wreaked havoc on your foes in the ancient land of the giants. Rallos Zek must have guided your blade.

The red and green as well as my war totem. I will guide your blade.' Your movement returns as Tenal falls to the ground, gasping for breath.||||||
30489|eastkarana|Tenal_Redblade|emote|%s looks at you oddly as you hand him the scales. 'What are..? 'You have done well, mortal, and you will be rewarded if you are truly brave.

Tenal drops to the ground as the last words leave his lips.'||||||
30490|eastkarana|Tenal_Redblade|emote|%s looks horrified as you give him the hand of the Maestro of Rancor and show him the mark of the sword.  The godlike voice returns, 'You have done well to acquire this. One final task must be completed before you hold the red scabbard in your mortal hands.' Tenal reaches out and hands you a note. 'Take this note and a wingblade of the spirocs to Kargek. When he receives them, I will speak to you one last time.'||||||

The Dire was powerful and yet you overcame him. Always remember that when you became Heyokah, it was the passing of a noble, yet misguided being that allowed you to do so. You should hold a special place in your heart for him and what he was in life. To help you remember him, we will fashion this pelt into a pair of boots and give them to you. With every step you take, you must think on the Dire, else his death be in vain forever.||||||
30526|emeraldjungle|Spirit_Sentinel|emote|%s Ahhh good, let us hope what you have found will point us in the right direction. Hmmm...this is interesting. It appears the disappearance of the first queen may have caused Rak'Ashiir's faith to decline. From there, the first King Rak laid down the groundwork for the city's eventual demise. We need to learn what happened to the queen. Perhaps bringing this knowledge to the King's now cursed form will lift the mantle. We've learned that the last lord of Torsis, Ghiosk, was a bit of a historian. Find him and see what you can learn about the queen. Take what you find to my brother here in the jungle beneath the murky waters of a pond.||||||
30527|emeraldjungle|Spirit_Sentinel_|say|Hmmm, it appears the queen's disappearance wasn't as random as we thought. It also looks as if this High Scale was having some sort of affair with Neh. We have little but speculation at this point so making it known to Nak'Ashiir would do nothing. Perhaps finding the resting place of the High Scale will show us more in the way of what really happened. We suspect the icon mentioned in this log could now be located in the city's old temple. Find the icon and bring it to Kirn, wherever he is. Tell me what you learn afterwards.||||||
30528|emeraldjungle|Spirit_Sentinel_|say|So, the truth is found!  Nak mourned over the loss of his child instead of relishing the blessing of his god, Cazic-Thule. His wife and the High Scale then abandoned him in disgust, but even that was an aftereffect of what caused the king to turn his back on his faith. The child is the key!  If we put the child to rest, Nak may repent of what he has done and the mantle may be lifted. The most difficult task is now at hand. Find the child, then take proof of her passing to Nak. I can feel the mantle's foundation crumbling!  Now, go!||||||
30529|emeraldjungle|Spirit_Sentinel_|emote|%s What is this?  The scale of Rak'Ashiir's father?  Then Rak has repented his mistake?  But why is the mantle still in place?  If Rak has repented, then the mantle should have dissolved since he was the one who initiated its construction.  But is its initiation the key?  How could we have been so blind?  Kirn said Rak'Ashiir had the blood of his people on his hands but that is false. Rak merely pointed to a path that would lead them to destruction.  It was the people who chose to follow. Now all is lost.||||||
30530|erudnext|Beth_Breadmaker|say|Ah yes! This is exactly what I am looking for, dear. Let me put these on the shelf right away. Here is some coin for your trouble. Perhaps we can do business again sometime.||||||
30531|erudnext|Beth_Breadmaker|say|Oh, wonderful fresh bread! Thank you for making the trip, that is such a long way. Here, I hope this covers your travel expenses. You have my deepest thanks.||||||

30537|erudnext|Collier|say|There is the weapon treatment I promised you. Use it in a forge with either a Long Sword or a Scimitar. Choose which weapon you prefer carefully as there is only enough of the substance for a single treatment.||||||
30538|erudnext|Depnar_Bulrious|say|Welcome to the Temple of Divine Light. I am Master Bulrious. Here. we study and spread the will of Quellious. Here is your guild tunic. Go find Jras Solsier. he will get you started with your first lesson.||||||
30539|erudnext|Dleria_Mausrel|say|So you wish to journey to Qeynos? So be it. Go to Qeynos and find me a willing convert. Ask them if they wish the blessing of Prexus. If so, they should snap their pole in two and you will return it to me. Do this and be rewarded.||||||
30540|erudnext|Dleria_Mausrel|say|Good work, young priest. Soon you shall carry the word of the Ocean Lord to distant lands. For now, continue your training. As for your reward, I have this which has been sitting in our vault. I hope it can be of use to a young priest such as yourself.||||||
30541|erudnext|Dleria_Mausrel|say|Peeuww!! That most certainly is zombie flesh!! Here is your reward. You have done a fine service in the name of Prexus. Soon you shall advance and we may tell you of greater dangers lurking in the depths.||||||

30544|erudnext|Jras_Solsier|say|You have served us well. The harmony of the forest shall be preserved. I have word that theses infidels were all working for one man. Find me evidence pertaining to this man. Surely one of these poachers has something which could aid in finding this man. We must stop him to stop the poachers. Go in peace.||||||
30545|erudnext|Jras_Solsier|say|It is done! Quellious will look favorably upon our church and we will look favorably upon you. Go in peace.||||||
30546|erudnext|Laoni_Reista|say|Good work. You have shown these rogues who are the better swimmers. Now we have proof of their involvement. You are a fine addition to the temple. Take this small reward. Go, and serve Prexus.||||||
30547|erudnext|Leraena_Shelyrak|say|Return to the Warrens and obtain eight of the bronze symbols worn by the kobolds greater shaman. Place them in this sack that has been blessed by the powers of Quellious to protect you from the evil influence of the evil symbols. Return the full sack with your initiate symbol of Quellious.||||||
30548|erudnext|Leraena_Shelyrak|say|Greetings. and welcome to the Temple of Divine Light! Here is your guild tunic. Serve Quellious well. Please see Lumi Stergnon - he has a task for you.||||||
30549|erudnext|Leraena_Shelyrak|say|It is imperative that we discern the nature of these symbols and the source of the kobolds shamanistic powers. There is a citizen of Erudin residing in Freeport named Glyssa Sonshaw. She is quite possibly the most knowledgeable individual in the field of heraldic and hieroglyphic studies. Take the high shamans necklace and this note to her. When you have discovered the nature of the symbols return to me with the documentation and your Disciple Symbol of Quellious.||||||
30550|erudnext|Leraena_Shelyrak|say|This is important news indeed. It seems there is a tribe of cat men in the Stonebrunt Mountains that wishes to form an alliance with Erudin. I must alert the High Council of this immediately, thank you for your services.||||||
30551|erudnext|Leraena_Shelyrak|say|I am unfamiliar with the markings that adorn these necklaces. You have done well thus far in hindering the kobolds worship of their evil deity. I award you the Initiate Symbol of Quellious. Return to me when you feel you are ready to deal with the greater kobold shaman.||||||
30552|erudnext|Leraena_Shelyrak|say|Fine work. They shall never lay hands upon another kobold again. I mean paws. Here is a small reward for a fine job. Unfortunatly we have recently learned that the shamen in the forest are merely underlings to more powerful kobold shamen that reside in the kobold warrens. Continue the work of Quellious.||||||
30553|erudnext|Leraena_Shelyrak|say|Your service to this temple is commendable. I award you the rank of Disciple for your devotions to The Tranquil. When you are ready to advance return to me and I will set you upon another task.||||||
30554|erudnext|Leraena_Shelyrak|say|You have done well yet again, young disciple. I award you the rank of Regent of the Peacekeepers. With this information we can hopefully gain some insight into the workings of the kobolds' religion.||||||
30555|erudnext|Lumi_Stergnon|say|In the mountain keep called High Hold, we have heard there is a person hiring mercenaries for an attempt to obtain a High Guard battle staff. We are missing one of our staffs and believe this person has it. Go to Highpass Hold and find this person. Return the High Guard battle staff to me!||||||
30556|erudnext|Lumi_Stergnon|say|This is fabulous work, my friend! You have served your people well. Take this as a gift. I hope it can be of use to you. We need proof of these skeletons' origins. Continue the eradication of the undead and find out who creates them. Once you know, bring their head to me.||||||
30557|erudnext|Lumi_Stergnon|say|You have done well, neophyte.Let me add the touch of harmony to finish the job.. Here, then. Take these supplies. I am sure you'll need them. Soon you may be able to assist us in important missions.||||||

30559|erudnext|Nolusia_Finharn|say|Fantastic. Now I can rest assured that my brother stands a better chance of finding the right path without that manipulating little man around. Master Lanken can rest assured that the waters are safe from abuse.||||||
30560|erudnext|Raine_Beteria|say|Your silver wand has been fully enchanted. Take it and the pouch of silver dust back to the temple of Ro.||||||
30561|erudnext|Raine_Beteria|say|Thank you very much. I have always wanted one of these! Hehehe? Just kidding. I see that you have enchanted this coin. I have placed the final enchantment on it - take it back to Romar.||||||
30562|erudnext|Rarnan_Lapice|say|I sent you after that book ages ago! What took you so long? I have already completed my studies. Luckily I found the original manuscript under my bedroll. I forgot I had kept it there. Take this as a token of my apology. Maybe it will aid you in your next book hunt. I know how cunning those books can be.||||||
30563|erudnext|Reklon_Gnallen|emote|%s presses the gem of purity against the breastplate. Its dark gleam softens and then glows bright once again. 'Compassion is strong in you. Few so called heroes would sacrifice their time for such a menial task as you performed. Continue your work. Hold this ancient breastplate until you have completed your task.||||||
30564|erudnext|Reklon_Gnallen|emote|%s washes the sword's blade in the water of purity. Its dark surface begins to shine, as true as the day it was forged. 'Such a sacrifice is rare among the poor. Truly, the woman must have loved her brother. Remember the lesson you have learned from her. Keep the sword until your work is done.'||||||
30565|erudnext|Reklon_Gnallen|say|I never thought our order would see these artifacts again. With the return of these relics we can now put at ease a scar upon the history of our order. This cleansing will atone for his failure. Your soul must be pure to have given so freely of yourself. Go now, take this crested token of our order. If you wish to free his soul you must undertake another sacrifice.||||||
30566|erudnext|Sinnkin_Highbrow|say|It's about time you figured it out, genius! Maybe you should spend more time in the library. Here, take this tonic and get out of here before they see me giving it to you and turn us both inside out.||||||

30568|erudnext|Ticar_Lorestring|say|Take this letter to Tralyn Marsinger in Qeynos.  You can find him at the bard guild hall.  I am sure he will compensate you for your troubles.||||||
30569|erudnext|Tomekeeper_Danl|emote|%s gasps at the sight of the rare book. 'This is a great find indeed! I can only imagine who you had to.. persuade to give you the book. Our library would be very interested in acquiring this and I am prepared to give you this referral that marks you as a friend of the library. If only Lheao could see this.'||||||
30570|erudnext|Vynon_Estaliun|say|Good work. I knew you could do it. Take this as reward.||||||
30571|erudnext|Weligon_Steelherder|say|We do not award the Deepwater harpoon to just any paladin. Nobility is all well and good, but you must still prove yourself.  We have heard rumors of a very distressing matter.  Perhaps it is your calling.  Are you ready to prove allegiance to Erudin and earn the Deepwater harpoon?||||||
30572|erudnext|Weligon_Steelherder|say|Very good, my dear young follower of Prexus. You will learn that swimming is a strong skill among the Deepwater Knights. Keep this up and you may wield a Deepwater harpoon soon enough. For now, you shall wear this barnacle breastplate. It is strong enough to aid a young knight in his quest for perfection.||||||
30573|erudnext|Weligon_Steelherder|say|Fine work, Deepwater Knight. You have proven yourself an excellent addition to our ranks. These shall be used to create more Peacekeeper staffs. Oh yes, I almost forgot your reward. Here you are. Now, go, and serve Prexus.||||||
30574|erudnext|Weligon_Steelherder|say|It is done!! I pray to Prexus that the knowledge of the bridge's design has departed from this world with the passing of these intelligent men. A pity they had to die. As for you, the other states may not tolerate your presence any longer, but you have proven that allegiance to Erudin is paramount among all Erudites. I am afraid the harpoon is no more!! I bestow upon you Deep Six, my personal cutlass!! May you wield it in the name of Erudin.||||||
30575|erudnext|Weligon_Steelherder|say|Greetings and welcome to the Deepwater Knights. Here is your guild tunic. Wear it with pride, and Prexus will keep a watchful eye on you. Go find sister Laoni, she will help you get started with your studies.||||||

Let's get you started. Here's your training robe.  Now, go find Raskena. She'll help train you and give you your first lesson.||||||
30583|erudnint|Josper_Kenshed|say|It seems my last apprentice was sent into Toxxulia to test a spell I call Ice Capade, well, everyone else calls it Column of Frost, how droll! Anyway... he never returned. I fear he is nothing more than BONES, though I hope I'm wrong. Could you find good old Ilanic and ask him, where is the scroll?! I do not wish it to fall into enemy hands. Return it and I shall let you keep the scroll. Oh yes, It is only half of a spell. I forgot to send him the full scroll. I imagine that is why he was not victorious.||||||
30584|erudnint|Josper_Kenshed|say|Well done, my young apprentice. I call you apprentice for you are nothing but a spark to my fire. This is the final component for my greatest creation. AHA!! I call it - iced tea!! Never again shall I boil under the hot sun. As for you, take this. It should serve you well. Now go away. There is no iced tea for you.||||||
30585|erudnint|Josper_Kenshed|say|I see you found Ilanic. How is he doing? I hope he is well. As for you, you may have the spell Ice Capa... err, I mean Column of Frost. Don't go and lose it now.||||||

30587|erudnint|Mairee_Silentone|emote|%s makes a few marks on the hammer, and all the while you can hear a muffled cursing coming from the hammer head. 'Yes, it is an ancient dwarf's hammer. Interesting artifact. I've marked it to keep it stable while you retrieve something for me. You need to travel to the Plane of Sky and find a swirling sphere of color. Bring it and the hammer back to me.'||||||
30588|erudnint|Mairee_Silentone|emote|%s holds the sphere and makes intricate marks and patterns on it, eventually turning the entire crystal clear. She rolls it across the hammer, raising a ringing sound in the room. 'There. Now take the hammer back to Kinlo. He'll know what to do from here. Good luck to you.'||||||
30589|erudnint|Markus_Jaevins|say|Welcome. young one! I see you show interest in the circle of magic. Nowhere upon Norrath will you find a greater school than this - the Gatecallers. You shall wear this tunic as a sign that you have begun the training of this circle. Remember. the power of the Gatecaller is the power of summoning. Go find Vasile. he will help teach you the basics of summoning. Good luck, friend!||||||

30593|erudnint|Shondo_Billin|say|Gulp.. Gulp.. Aaahhh!!! That hits the spot. All I can tell you is that the heretic's name was E'lial B'rook. He mumbled something about a rendezvous and he would be floating down a river, smooth sailing back to something called Paineel. That's all I know.||||||
30594|erudnint|Trilani_Parlone|say|I sense a great evil power in this candlestick. I will need you to concoct a divinatory aid for me before I can discern more. Take this suspension and brew it in a brew barrel with one white hellebore, a pouch of the red dust created by the Fire Peak Goblin Wizards, and the caustic substance used by the werebats in Unrest.||||||
30595|erudnint|Trilani_Parlone|emote|%s performs a subtle divinatory ritual. 'This is a powerful evil indeed. The smoke from special candles crafted by the Teir'Dal and burned in this candlestick allows the creation of undead of unordinary might. The Ghasts are only one of its many possible creations. I will concoct a powder for you to take back to Yeolarn that will assist in defeating the monstrosities the candle has produced. The candlestick itself will remain here within the High Tower of Erudin for the time being.'||||||
30596|erudnint|Trilani_Parlone|say|Oh my lord Tunare! I did not know my daughter was in trouble. I thank you for saving her. Here, I have returned the once lost power to this cloak. Wear it with my humblest gratitude.||||||
30597|erudnint|Vasile_Jahnir|say|You have mastered these spells quickly. You shall now wear the gloves of the Gatecaller. Cumbersome they may feel, but they protect the hands of a young magician. In your young days of magic they will protect you from harm. They are not valued much by merchants, but they are prized by other circles. Nevertheless, we offer them only to our young Gatecallers. You may now be of assistance with a slight problem.||||||
30598|erudnint|Vasile_Jahnir|say|So the rumor shows true. Good work. You are an excellent student and a noble Erudite. Here is your spell as I promised. Go forth and fill your brain with knowledge.||||||

30633|felwithea|Challice|say|Oh yes? Arantir? What a fool he was! the man gave me everything, but for all his intelligence, he could never understand why I was truly with him. It was for his power he could do anything. But when he mysteriously lost it, he became just another toy. I never loved him. Return this ring to him. He will understand that I have no desire to see him again.||||||
30634|felwithea|Elia_the_Pure|emote|%s squints and turns her head. 'By the gods, such a twisted aura this has! To see it hurts my eyes. I will help you if for no other reason than to remove such a twisted thing from existence.' She unrolls a scroll from her pack and softly chants over the dark metal shield. She hands it back to you with an exhausted smile on her face. 'Your heart seems pure. If I was able to help at all, I am honored. May the light shine warmly upon you.'||||||
30635|felwithea|General_Jyleel|say|So, the Teir'Dal are behind the recent advances of the orcs?!! Your news has shed light on their union. It is time to step forth and prove yourself a faithful paladin of this court.||||||
30636|felwithea|General_Jyleel|say|A noble deed has been done and the alliance of evil has been stalled. I present you with the falchion of the Koada`Vie. You are now an honorable member of our order. Hail Felwithe, and may you defender her with honor.||||||
30637|felwithea|Guard_Settine|say|I.. but.. she.. You can take this. I guess I don't need it any more.||||||
30638|felwithea|Merchant_Nora|say|You hardly look like the type of errand runner Farios usually sends out to fetch his groceries but here they are. I hope he chokes on them. Oh, and tell him he still owes me five gold for his last order!||||||
30639|felwithea|Seria_Woodwind|say|Our diviner in the Keepers of the Art have discovered that a Teir`Dal agent of the Ebon Mask, the spies and assassins of the Teir`Dal has been lurking around the Faydarks and communicating intelligence to the orcs of Clan Crushbone. We believe the spy can be lured out of hiding if his primary orc contact, a crushbone centurion by the name of Relgle, is eliminated on route to their rendezvous location. Find this Centurion Relgle, slay him for his crimes against the Koada`Dal, then do the same to his Teir`Dal ally. Bring me both their heads when the deed is done.||||||
30640|felwithea|Seria_Woodwind|say|Good work  $N.  King Tearis Thex and the Royal Order of the Koada'Vie shall be pleased.  Take the Dull Felwithe Defenders Sword to a forge and sharpen it with a sharpening stone.  It may take you several attempts if you are unfamiliar with the process.  Once that is accomplished bring me the Sharp Felwithe Defenders Sword, a Pristine Forest Drakeling Scale, and an Arborean Amber and I will put the finishing touches on the weapon.||||||
30641|felwithea|Seria_Woodwind|emote|%s fashions a grip from the pristine forest drakeling scales, fastens the arborean amber to the pommel of the hilt and polishes the blade of the sword with a luminescent substance. 'Here is your new weapon young defender. May it serve you well in your service to the Koada'Vie.'||||||
30642|felwithea|Tacar_Tissleplay|say|Take this letter to Jakum Webdancer in Kelethin.  You can find him at the bard guild hall.  I am sure he will compensate you for your troubles.||||||
30643|felwithea|Terren_Starwatcher|say|To assemble a sylvan initiate breastplate you will need to obtain four bricks of crude bronze and smelt them in a forge with a Water Flask and this Crude Breastplate Mold. Once that is done, combine the Crude Bronze Breastplate with a Giant Sylvan Bat Fur, and two Mature Arborean Barks in the Mail Assembly Kit.||||||
30644|felwithea|Terren_Starwatcher|say|You have done well young  $N. If you continue to show such devotion to your people and your faith then perhaps one day you will serve in the chambers of King Tearis Thex himself. Take this Rusty Sylvan Morning Star and scrape the rust from it in a forge with a sharpening stone. It may take several attempts if you are unfamiliar with the process. Once that is done bring me the Refined Sylvan Morning Star, a Pristine Drakeling Scales, and an Arborean Amber.||||||
30645|felwithea|Terren_Starwatcher|say|Terren Starwatcher fashions a grip out of the pristine forest drakeling scales, fastens the arborean amber to the pommel, and polishes the head of the morning star with a luminescent substance. 'I grant you a Sylvan Initiate Morning Star. May it serve you well in your service to The All Mother.||||||
30646|felwithea|Tolkar_Parlone|say|Oh, my, she did get herself into some trouble! I thank you for rescuing her, my friend. Here, take this old cloak. I am afraid its power has faded, but if you bring it to my wife, she might be able to do something for you. She is currently studying in Erudin.||||||
30647|felwithea|Tolon_Nurbyte|despawn|self||||||
30647|felwithea|Tolon_Nurbyte|say|So I see you completed your mission. Good work. You just may be a member of the Silent Watch someday. Well my friend. I will be keeping my eye on you. No doubt we will meet again. Oh, I almost forgot. The Princess wanted you to have this. Now show yourself the door.||||||
30648|felwithea|Tynkale|say|Greetings. young paladin!  I am Master Tynkale of the Clerics of Tunare.  Here. we shall teach and train you in the skills needed to defeat our evil and diseased enemies.  Take this, our guild tunic - it will help protect you. Wear it with pride, for you are now one of us.||||||
30649|felwithea|Tynkale|say|So you have proven yourself to be a great slayer of beasts.Now it is time to prove yourself to be an asset to the Crown. You are to meet a man named Tolon Nurbyte. He will be at the local inn. Go to him and repeat the phrase, 'The glory of the Mother shines bright.' I can say no more. Oh.. and here. This may help you on your upcoming adventure.||||||
30650|felwithea|Yeolarn_Bronzeleaf|say|Praise Tunare!! You have done well young Initiate. Here the symbol of your station within our faith. Return to me when you are ready to slay the necromancer that has been creating the undead.||||||
30651|felwithea|Yeolarn_Bronzeleaf|say|Praise Tunare!! I will have our sorcerers examine this power immediately to see if we can reproduce it in quantities enough to eliminate the undead plague. I award you the rank of Warden of Tunare, the All Mother smiles upon you,  $N!||||||
30652|felwithea|Yeolarn_Bronzeleaf|say|Welcome, friend, to the Clerics of Tunare. I am Yeolarn Bronzeleaf, head of the guild and devout follower of Tunare. Here is your guild tunic - it will help to protect you against this world's evils.||||||
30652|felwithea|Yeolarn_Bronzeleaf|say|Your faith has not grown strong enough to undertake that task young one.||||||
30654|felwitheb|Elishia_Leafrunner|say|Oh, a letter from my grandson? Thank you very much. I haven't been able to talk to him recently. Would you mind taking a letter back to him for me?||||||
30655|felwitheb|Farios_Elianos|say|Eh? What is this? A cracked earthen pot? Why in the nine hells would I need a crushed pot? Perhaps I could use it to not hold water! Why did you even bother me with this? Are you mentally deficient? Apparently. Oh, well, you're just a servant boy. Well, then, we'll make you useful, if just a little. Take this shopping list and go get my groceries. Take it to Nora in the tavern. She'll know what I need.||||||
30656|felwitheb|Farios_Elianos|say|Ah, good. Here's a few copper and a receipt for services rendered. Now be off, I'm sure citizens across the land are in dire need of broken pots at right this moment.||||||
30657|felwitheb|Joren_Nobleheart|say|Vengeance has been fufilled! However, the King still has a heavy heart. Not until Firiona has been returned can this sadness be lifted. But in appreciation of your efforts, I am honored to present to you the King's Chalice.||||||
30658|felwitheb|Kinool_Goldsinger|say|Greetings and welcome aboard!  My name's Kinool. Master Enchanter of the Keepers of the Art.  Here is your guild tunic. Make us proud, young pupil!||||||
30659|felwitheb|Kinool_Goldsinger|say|Fine work!! I now reward you with The Rain Caller.||||||
30660|felwitheb|Niola_Impholder|say|Welcome. I am Niola Impholder. Master Magician of the Keepers of the Art. Here is our guild tunic. You have much to learn, so let's get started.||||||
30661|felwitheb|Niola_Impholder|say|What? Not as supposed? What can he... Well, that's all well and good. You, I assume, wish a reward for your 'valiant work'? Well, here you go, adventurer.||||||
30662|felwitheb|Tarker_Blazetoss|say|Welcome to the wizards' guild of the Keepers of the Art. My name's Tarker, and I run this guild. You've got a lot of training ahead of you, so let's get started. Here, take this - it's our guild tunic. Wear it with honor, friend.||||||
30663|felwitheb|Tarker_Blazetoss|say|This is just what I needed.. and with hardly a mark on it! You have my thanks. Here is a something that you might find useful.||||||
30664|felwitheb|Yuin_Starchaser|say|The entrance to the Citadel can be found on the northern edge of the Greater Faydark. Once within the citadel seek out the Orc Thaumaturgist and obtain his book of spells. Once you are in possession of the Orc Thaumaturgists Spell Book return it to me so that the masters of the Keepers of the Art may study its contents.||||||
30665|felwitheb|Yuin_Starchaser|say|Well done young Art Keeper. Take this Rough Art Keepers Initiate Staff and go forth and gather a Pristine Forest Drakeling Scales and an Arborean Amber. When you have acquired those two items return them to me with the Rough Art Keepers Initiate Staff and I will put the final touches on the staff.||||||
30666|felwitheb|Yuin_Starchaser|emote|%s fashions a grip for the staff from the pristine forest drakeling scales, places the arborean amber into a mithril fixture and attaches the fixture to one end of the staff. 'Here is your new staff young Art Keeper may it serve you well in the pursuit of your studies.'||||||
30667|fieldofbone|a_lesser_spirit|say|That is good,  $N. Take this gem. It is a part of us like the clouds to the sky and is a wonderful gift from the grandfather. Take this gem to where the humans gather to spoil the land and water. Some call it a port. There you will find one of us, a shaman like yourself. Give him the gem and perhaps he will tell you more of the spirits.||||||
30668|fieldofbone|Crusader_Quarg|say|Ah, i see you have proven yourself to Zand and he wishes to see more of your prowess.  go to the Tower of Kurn and bring him the Skulls of the Caste of Bone Brethren, a caste of powerful shamans who perished fighting undead in the Field of Bone several decades ago.||||||
30669|fieldofbone|Crusader_Quarg|say|The temple shall be pleased. As instructed by the Hierophants, here is your Iron Cudgel of the Mystic. You have done well that I must ask you to collect the Crusaders of Rok Nilok.||||||
30670|fieldofbone|Oracle_Qulin|emote|%s begins to chant. Quietly at first but then louder and faster. He speaks a language you only vaguely recognize. It is the voice and language of the ancient oracles. His voice booms out over the water filling your mind with images of the ancient Sebilisian empire and the great Iksar rulers of old.||||||
30670|fieldofbone|Oracle_Qulin|emote|%s dips the skull in the crystal waters. He lifts the skull over his head and stands completely still, allowing the water to drip down off the skull down over his body and finally on to the parched sand.'||||||
30670|fieldofbone|Oracle_Qulin|emote|%s runs his scaled fingers slowly over the cracked, brittle skull. 'Granix did well to send you to me, I may yet be able to recover the spirit of this ancient and set it free. Come! I shall need your help with this ritual.'||||||
30670|fieldofbone|Oracle_Qulin|emote|%s's voice stops suddenly, leaving the air completely silent. Even the waves seem to have stopped for a moment. You begin to move toward him, but he raises a hand toward you motioning for you to stay still.||||||
30670|fieldofbone|Oracle_Qulin|say|Suddenly without warning the skull flies from Quilin's hands and flies into the murky waters. It stays submerged for a moment and then flies toward you, but this time an entire corpse is attached to it.||||||
30670|fieldofbone|Oracle_Qulin|spawn|78000|playerX|playerY|playerZ|playerHeading|5|
30671|fieldofbone|Oracle_Qulin|say|It seems this particular ancient does not wish to be put to rest. Return this note to Hierophant Granix and tell him what happened. He will surely wish this skull to be disposed of properly, but I do not have the power to do it myself.||||||
30672|fieldofbone|Oracle_Vauris|emote|%s takes the necklace from you without a word. He looks into your eyes for a moment. He seems to be searching for something. Apparently he finds whatever he was looking for as he pulls an empty bag from his belt. He takes the necklace and snaps the cord with his teeth allowing the skulls to fall into the bag. He looks you square in the eyes again and motions for you to put out your hand. You do so and almost immediately regret it. Vauris takes the knife from his belt and slices open your forearm allowing your blood to fall into the bag. He uses the cord to tie the bag and hands it back to you. 'You now share the mark of Rile,  $N. Your fates are intertwined.'||||||
30673|fieldofbone|Oracle_Vauris|say|You have done well  $N. Now it is time for the true test of your clairvoyance. Only a true Scaled mystic will be able to put these spirits to rest. Be warned, these souls will not go quietly into the next world. They have strong ties to this land, and it is these ties we must break. Take them to the City of the Kunzar, the birthplace of the emperor. Only there will you be able to tear asunder the dark rituals that have twisted the souls of our ancient heroes. I will await you in that place  $N.||||||
30674|fieldofbone|Trooper_Gummin|emote|%s slowly signs the order. '...Love, Innoruuk. There you go. Now run along. Let me enjoy my last brew alone.'||||||
30675|fieldofbone|Trooper_Mozo|emote|%s gasp's in astonishment.||||||
30675|fieldofbone|Trooper_Mozo|say|Wha...? This!! But... I... Why you... I oughta.. All right!! A bet is a bet. Here you go. A few silver piece's for your achievement. What?!! You thought I would give you ten? Fat chance! Now get lost or I will haul you in for impersonating a froglok.||||||
30676|fieldofbone|Trooper_Taer|say|Ha ha! Look at all the names. Ozlot and Frogzin. What lushes. Here you are. I can't imagine there being any others to sign. This is the entire Cabilis brew brigade. Alas... Disbanded forever.||||||
30677|fieldofbone|Warlord_Zyzz|say|Magnificent!! The more pincers I get the lesser scorpions there are. Here. Take the bounty.||||||
30678|fieldofbone|Warlord_Zyzz|say|Ah!! Good to have you on board. We lack strong young recruits such as yourself. Take this box. Your task is to seek milita skeletons near this gate. Apparently, someone or something has been raising militia corpses and they now walk the land not knowing the difference between friend or foe. They even continue using their old call, 'Halt Who goes there?'. Fill and combine within the box their charred bone shards and return the filled box to me for your geozite tool.||||||
30679|fieldofbone|Warlord_Zyzz|say|Very fine work, young  $N. You will make a fine trooper, should you survive long enough. As promised, here is your geozite tool. Be sure to visit the legion weaponsmith to learn how to use it. Farewell.||||||
30680|firiona|#Kwinn_the_Outlander|emote|%s takes out an extra pack. 'Thought you might be interested. I don't want to take a loss and I only trade for things I am hunting, so here!! Inside this pack you need to combine the following items a sabertooth tiger mane, a pair of pygmy brute choppers, a lime plume and a war bone fist. Return the full sack to me and the tail is yours.'||||||
30681|firiona|#Kwinn_the_Outlander|say|Kackling Quellious!! This will bring a fortune on the black market!! Well, a deal is a deal. Here is the tail.||||||
30682|firiona|#Realla_Segoan|say|Excellent! Take this Research Binder and fill it with the research notes when you find them. Once it is filled, seal it and take it to Noilgin Mindtune here at the outpost, so that he may deliver it to Erudin. Be forewarned though, it will be a dangerous path to follow. Most likely, the research notes have fallen into possession of some very dangerous beings.||||||
30683|firiona|Allaria_Sneakyfeet|say|Very well then. Here are the plans for the weapon that is said to cut holes into the enemy without much effort. Legend has it that if the wind is blowing, your enemy will be whistling after the fight. But they won't be whistling voluntarily.' Allaria smiles. 'Good luck to you friend.||||||
30684|firiona|Captain_Keatar|say|You serve this outpost well. Here is a small reward. You should try to hunt down goblin battlemasters. I have very few resources to send into the plains to track them down. Perhaps you can help us.||||||
30685|firiona|Captain_Keatar|say|Good work! Please accept this piece of armor. It was crafted in Felwithe for the swiftly moving rangers of this outpost.||||||
30686|firiona|Captain_Nealith|emote|%s tosses the teeth into a very large cask full of similar teeth. 'Fine work,  $N. I wish all my own troops showed the same tenacity. I salute you. This will keep you well fed during your long patrols. Use your wages to better equip yourself. Continue the fight!! The General is pleased.'||||||
30687|firiona|Captain_Nealith|emote|%s nearly faints after reading the letter. 'Dear Marltek!! I shall miss you. There is more evil in this land!! Madness beyond description. Thank you  $N. You put my soul at ease and give me new direction. Please accept my brothers blade. He found it in the wilds. May you use it to slay many Drolvarg!!'||||||
30688|firiona|Despondo|say|This bottle is for the one called Hampton. If you look well, you can see his name. ||||||
30689|firiona|Despondo|say|Identify this when the time comes. It is Ryla's prison.||||||
30690|firiona|Despondo|say|This bottle is for Mardon. You may be able to identify his name upon it. ||||||
30691|firiona|Despondo|emote|%s embraces the bottles as if they were babes. 'Rejoice my friends!! Your souls are safe.  $N, you are a good wizard. You deserve to know the secret of concussion.'||||||
30692|firiona|Drake_Mountainstorm|emote|%s examines the fire emerald, reaches into his pouch and hands you another. 'There you go, it doesn't look special but it is. If you don't believe me I'll take another look at it. Just remember this special fire emerald only has one purpose!'||||||
30693|firiona|Foloal_Stormforest|emote|%s blinks and carefully takes the stones from you, cautiously scratching the jagged green stone against the other. Its skin seems to shiver and flake at the contact and eventually begins to shine brightly. 'With the gem nature's balance is complete. Take the stone and walk your path. Blade or lightning caller, burning sword or the mother's walk.'||||||
30694|firiona|Gearin_Gaxx|emote|%s places the formula in a box which appears to have similar copies in it. Thank you! I can now reward you with this Guard of Ik shield I had lying around.||||||
30696|firiona|Luminare_Pasinia|emote|%s places the items into a sack and removes a scroll from her robe. This is yours. A spell I discovered and translated for one with less intelligence than the great Luminare of Firiona Vie. You may kiss my feet now.||||||
30697|firiona|Marlyn_McMerin|say|What's this? This is amazing - you collected them all! To think, the power that these items hold if properly used. Never mind that now, here, take the scroll. You've certainly earned it.||||||
30698|firiona|Nadia_Starfeast|emote|%s jumps. Eeekk... a scorpion. I thought they rid this area of these critters. Those things give me the creepers. Take this emerald and be on your way.||||||
30699|firiona|Nadia_Starfeast|say|Oh it must be time to reveal the staff! The piece I will help you craft is encrusted with magical gems. These gems contain the essence of various creatures. Alone they have very little power. Combined together they are much more powerful. They must be combined in a sack. Just ask if you don't have one.||||||
30700|firiona|Nadia_Starfeast|say|Lovely! You are indeed quite the charmer. Here, take the third part, and seek out the last master. The time draws near.||||||
30701|firiona|Noilgin_Mindtune|say|Oh no! I have been tracked down. Can't I have a moment's peace? I'm sorry you went through all the trouble to get this to me, but I'm not delivering mail right now. I'm trying to take a vacation. You'll have to deliver it to Lanivon Baxer in the Toxxulia Forest yourself. Here, take it back. I have packaged it up nicely for the journey.||||||
30702|firiona|Shrub_Marwood|emote|%s tosses the mantrap root out the window.. SPLASH!! 'I made a mistake. I didn't need that one. Here is the shillelagh I told you about. I found it in some burned out woods far from here. I cleaned it up and found it had a spark of mana so I had it enchanted with a few charges of my spell, Fertile Crop. Hope you like it.'||||||
30703|firiona|Shrub_Marwood|say|Great work! I wish I had the coin to hire you on permanently. Maybe I will, when I find the lost trade city of Torsis. Here is the spell I copied for you. Careful, the ink is still drying.||||||
30704|firiona|Squire_Fuzzmin|emote|%s tumbles around and stands on his hands. With his feet he pulls a long polearm from a nearby weapons cache!! 'Woohoo!! I can taste the brew in Freeport already. Here you are my friend. A real Wurmslayer!!'||||||
30705|firiona|Tiblner_Milnik|say|Take this Element and keep it with you. I wish you the best in your journey, but I must ask you to leave me now. This frantic pace you set makes me nervous.||||||
30706|firiona|Tracker_Azeal_|despawn|self||||||
30706|firiona|Tracker_Azeal_|emote|%s begins to pull his face off.. it is a disguise!! 'Aha!! You have made it!! I cannot see well in this disguise, but I thought I smelled you. I have news of the Charasis tome.'||||||

30709|firiona|Wellford_Fargin|say|Wow!! I never thought I would ever see these in my entire life.  Please take this and Thank you!!!!||||||

30712|freporte|Brutol_Rhaksen|say|Ready to make yourself useful  $N ? Beneath West Freeport are sewer tunnels leading to North Freeport being used by the Knights of Truth and the Sentries and Passion that have gained too much notoriety with the Freeport Militia and the Dismal Rage to pass safely through the eastern and western quarters of Freeport. We believe a sympathizer of the Sentries of Passion, Tarsa Yovar, is hiding somewhere in the western tunnel system. The sympathizer is a Steel Warrior faithful to Erollisi and although she is only a minor nuisance must be dealt with. Find her and bring me her head.||||||
30713|freporte|Brutol_Rhaksen|say|Hahaha.. I sure hope you prove more valuable than you look, little one.||||||
30714|freporte|Brutol_Rhaksen|say|Take this and get it sharpened. Bring it back to me with a Giant Rattlesnake Skin and you will have proven yourself able to wield a Dismal Rage Battle Axe, to help teach the way of Innoruuk!||||||
30715|freporte|Brutol_Rhaksen|say|You have proven your faith  $N. Take this to vanquish any and all whom question the absolute power of Innoruuk!||||||
30716|freporte|Elisi_Nasin|say|Welcome to the Coalition of Tradesfolk underground. We like to keep a low profile around here and not draw any unneeded attention to our operations, you following me? I hope so, for your sake. Anyways, Nestral T'Gaza is in charge with helping out our newest members. Go see her as soon as you get a chance.||||||
30717|freporte|Fabian|say|Rat spittle! Busted another string! You seem like a good music loving citizen, could you please run to the Wind Spirit's Song and grab me a fresh set of lute strings?||||||
30718|freporte|Fabian|say|'My lucky coin! How did it get in there? Well, never mind that. You are an honest person and although honesty is its own reward, I feel obligated to return the favor. Take this to Dionna if you enjoy music. Farewell friend!||||||
30719|freporte|Giz_Dinree|say|I am glad to see you. We have a problem. The last runner and I attempted to carry the chest from a boat. It fell overboard! He went in after it, but the sharks made a meal of him. If you want to try and get it, it is down below in the water in the harbor. Be careful.||||||
30720|freporte|Gregor_Nasin|say|Now I have every ingredient mentioned in the Barkeep Compendium. Here. You take it. <..click!.> Whoops!! I just closed it. It's magically sealed, I never closed it before. It's useless to you. I have no need for it any longer. Maybe you can return it to Clurg for some type of reward.||||||
30721|freporte|Gren_Frikniller|say|Elisi runs the show around here.  She's usually a pretty busy lady.  Dang smart, too.  And it's my sworn duty to protect her at any cost, even with my very own life.||||||
30722|freporte|Gren_Frikniller|say|What's this? Oh, ol' Grandpa Frikniller's lucky necklace, huh? I'll bet this broken piece of junk won't even get me a sip of ale up at the bar. And lucky? How lucky could this thing be? Poor gramps was lonely and copperless his whole life. Bah!! Oh, well. Here's some coin for your efforts, thanks,  $N.||||||
30723|freporte|Groflah_Steadirt|say|This used to be hanging in Zimel's Blades. It is the price list. It is badly faded though. There was a fire in Zimel's Blades and I was on the scene just afterward. I did not see this hanging. I wonder who took it . . . Hmmmm.. oh, yes.. the markings on the list! It is a code! Here. I will fill it in. Read it. You probably do not even know who Ariska is.||||||

30728|freporte|Guard_Bribbely|say|Yes, what is it, citizen?' Bribbely reads the note from Jasmine. 'Great, just what I need.' Guard Bribbely sighs. 'I have been a member of the guard for twenty years, investigating countless thefts and other crimes against Freeport and you think you can just waltz in here and solve this? You adventurers are all the same. Ok, 'investigator', if you think you are so smart, here is what we know so far: After the trolls attacked the ship, one of them was left behind and captured by us. After being beat, er questioned, the troll eventually told us that they were from Broken Skull Rock and that is probably where they took our captured ship. He didn't know about any mail, but says that any loot onboard was most likely taken to the Crypts of Nadox to await distribution by treasure sorters to the trolls there as payment. Further questioning revealed that a ship on the shores of Stonebrunt can take people to Broken Skull.||||||
30729|freporte|Gunex_Eklar|say|It has come to our attention that a paladin of the Sentries of Passion, Raenna Griff, has been aiding sympathizers and wanted members of the Sentries of Passion and the Knights of Truth in the sewer tunnels beneath the western quarter of Freeport. The incompetent Freeport Militia has yet to capture these wanted followers of the Mar twins. We will wait for their capture no longer. Seek this Raenna Griff individual and slay her. I want her head presented to me this very night!||||||
30730|freporte|Gunex_Eklar|say|It took you long enough. I wonder if the Militia will be able to identify the body minus its head. Take this Dull Dismal Long Sword and sharpen it in a forge with a sharpening stone. It may take you several attempts if you are unfamiliar with the process. Once that is accomplished deliver the Sharpened Dismal Long Sword and a Giant Rattlesnake Skin to Quan Nektogo. He will make the final preparations on your weapon.||||||
30731|freporte|Harkin_Duskfoot|say|Ok,  $N, I need you to take this message to Janam in West Freeport. He is usually hanging out in front of the Theater of the Tranquil with that good-for-nothing Rebby. Anyway, give this note to Janam and bring his reply back to me.||||||
30732|freporte|Harkin_Duskfoot|say|Ah, good work,  $N. And quick too, I'll makes sure that Elisi hears of your loyal work. Here... take this for your efforts.. it's not much, but it's all I have on me right now.||||||
30733|freporte|Heneva_Jexsped|say|Welcome, friend. I see more than a slight glimmer of hate in your eyes. Good... for we have much work to do.||||||
30734|freporte|Innkeep_Hunter|say|These are quality muffins! You are obviously quite a skilled baker. Here is your payment as promised. Now I can get back to business again.||||||
30735|freporte|Innkeep_Hunter|say|Oh, wonderful fresh bread! Thank you for making the trip, that is such a long way. Here, I hope this covers your travel expenses. You have my deepest thanks.||||||
30736|freporte|Innkeep_Nasumi|say|Ah yes! This is exactly what I am looking for, dear. Let me put these on the shelf right away. Here is some coin for your trouble. Perhaps we can do business again some time.||||||

30742|freporte|Jerra_Renlock|say|To assemble Dismal priest Vambraces you will need to obtain two bricks of crude iron and smelt them in a forge with a Water Flask and this Crude Vambrace Mold. Once that is done combine the Crude Iron Vambraces with a Low Quality Coyote Pelt and two Large Fire Beetle Patella in the Mail Assembly Kit.||||||
30743|freporte|Jerra_Renlock|say|Ah, so Zhem wants me to assist you with some armor. You will surely need it if you are an associate of the likes of him. This Mail Assembly Kit will be needed for you to construct your armor. The materials required depend on the armor section you plan to construct. Do you plan to construct a dismal priest helm, a dismal priest bracer, dismal priest gauntlets, dismal priest boots, dismal priest vambraces, dismal priest greaves, or a dismal priest breastplate.||||||
30744|freporte|Jerra_Renlock|emote|%s fashions a grip out of the giant rattlesnake skin and polishes the head of the flail with a strange glowing substance. This will make a fine weapon for a young Priest of Rage.||||||
30745|freporte|Jheron_Felkis|say|So you are from Umvera! What is this? Oh my! INtersting! I'll bind them right away! A little snip here..a little snip there.. All done! That didn't take long, did it? I won't be doing this forever, you know. After the milita burned down my father's home, he could not afford to send me through proper schooling. Ah well, such is life!||||||
30746|freporte|Jyle_Windshot|say|Thanks, friend. I have run a long way to get here in time. Mostly at night. I lost my lantern in a card game in Highkeep.||||||
30747|freporte|Kargek_Redblade|say|An associate of mine is wandering somewhere in the Feerrott. His name is Oknoggin Stonesmacker. If you will deliver this note to him, I would appreciate it.||||||
30748|freporte|Kargek_Redblade|say|What is this? A note from my brother? Thank you for the gift as well.' Kargek reads the note and hands you the huge sword hilt. Your mind is filled with the sound of battle and a voice. 'Place the ancient sword blade, ancient blade, finely crafted dragon head hilt and the jeweled dragon head hilt into the scabbard to receive your rewards. If you think you are worthy, place your rewards into the scabbard and see what havoc you can unleash on the world. Kargek addresses you as you turn to leave. 'One more thing. Gartrog over there has told me of a great discovery. Seems there are all sorts of stones being found in the recently discovered lost dungeons scattered around Antonica. The Wayfarer's Brotherhood has found a way to make items even more powerful by using the stones with existing items.||||||
30749|freporte|Kargek_Redblade|say|Thank you for delivering the note to my associate. Take this book - it will tell you a little of the history of the old scabbard. If you would like to own the scabbard, seek out my younger brother Tenal and give him the book.||||||
30750|freporte|Konious_Eranon|say|Hey, Nex, we got another sucker.. er.. volunteer, that is, to help us out around here. Here ya go friend, put this on and let's whip you into shape.||||||
30751|freporte|Lenka_Stoutheart|say|Oh!! You must work for that Erudite named Palatos. I guess he won't have to spend anymore money drinking in Freeport. Here. Here is the portrait I kept until he could get me a new boat beacon.||||||
30752|freporte|Lenka_Stoutheart|say|You found my pouch! Thanks kid. Let me buy you A drink and this is for the good work. Hmmmm. It looks as though they took my voucher. Darn it! Hey... It looks like they were using my bag to hold items they were stealing. Here you go. You can have it. It looks like junk.||||||
30753|freporte|Marv_Orilis|say|The Dismal Rage has many enemies still here in Freeport that would uncover us and see us destroyed. Lately a wizard of the Arcane Scientists, Yovik Splegle, has been asking questions about Opal Darkbriar. Find this inquisitive wizard and silence him for good. When you have completed the task return to me with the wizards head.||||||
30754|freporte|Marv_Orilis|say|Poor, poor Yovik Splegle. Haha! Excellent work,  $N. Quickly, fetch me a giant rattlesnake skin and a giant leaf scarab eye along with your Rough Hewn Dismal Staff and I will construct you the Staff of Dismal Rage before your very eyes.||||||
30756|freporte|Nestral_TGaza|say|Well, um, I ah, I have to go now, thank you for the information, I have to make sure it goes to the right ears.||||||
30757|freporte|Nestral_TGaza|say|Thank you  $N, You have done well.||||||
30758|freporte|Netuk_Phenzon|say|It is about time you returned! Innoruuk would be proud of the red you have spread upon the land.||||||
30759|freporte|Nexvok_Thirod|say|Ah ha.. Fresh meat. here, put this on.. you're one of us now. Do your best to do your worst.||||||
30760|freporte|Olunea_Miltin|say|Great! Thank you stranger. The rogues must have broken it. At least I could repair it. It would be seasons before I could afford another pole.||||||
30761|freporte|Opal_Darkbriar|say|Welcome to the Guild, here's your guild robe. Now, let's get to work.||||||
30762|freporte|Palatos_Kynarn|say|Ahh... I... <Hic!> Need help... <Hic!>  You... take this... Go build... boat beacon. <Hic!>  Ask gnomes about... <Hic!> boat beacon. They know how... Then bring back... <Hic!> Unnnhh! Prexus help me! I will never drink again.||||||
30763|freporte|Palatos_Kynarn|say|Thanks.. That saved me a lot of money. Now I can spend more time with the captain before I give this back to Lenka Stoutheart. Here is a little so...mething.||||||
30764|freporte|Palatos_Kynarn|say|Wise decision!! Little reward for a large deed. Bye.||||||
30765|freporte|Pietro_Zarn|say|A new member to carry the rage of Innoruuk into the city and beyond. How wonderful. I must admit that you do not appear to carry the rage within. Hopefully you shall color the battlefields with the blood of many knights from the Hall of Truth. Here. Wear this tunic with pride. Once you are ready to begin your training please make sure that yo see Gunex Eklar, he can assist you in developing your hunting and gathering skills. Return to me when you have become more experienced in our art, I will be able to further instruct you on how to progress through your early ranks, as well as in some of the various trades you will have available to you.||||||
30766|freporte|Pietro_Zarn|say|You have proven yourself truly evil. Your hatred shall shine from this day forth. Innoruuk commands that I reward you with this. It is called Rage and it serves the powers of hate. Use it to smite the forces of good. Hail Innoruuk!||||||
30767|freporte|Quan_Nektogo|say|To assemble Dismal Knight Vambraces you will need to obtain two bricks of crude iron and smelt them in a forge with a Water Flask and this Crude Vambrace Mold. Once that is done combine the Crude Iron Vambraces with a Low Quality Cat Pelt and two Large Leaf Scarab Patella in the Mail Assembly Kit.||||||
30768|freporte|Quan_Nektogo|emote|%s fashions a grip out of the giant rattlesnake skin and polishes the blade of the sword with a strange glowing substance. 'May your new sword see the deaths of many enemies!||||||
30769|freporte|Quan_Nektogo|say|Sorry buddy I didn't realize you were one of us. I've got no problem helping out an associate of Gunex. You'll need this Mail Assembly Kit to construct your new armor. The materials required depend on the section of armor you're planning on crafting. Do you plan on crafting a dismal knight helm, a dismal knight bracer, dismal knight gauntlets, dismal knight boots, dismal knight vambraces, dismal knight greaves, or a dismal knight breastplate.||||||
30770|freporte|Raltur_Caliskon|say|So the great Antonius Bayle wishes to ally himself with the mighty Knights of Truth. How pathetic. It would appear that the alliance has spawned infiltrators of sorts. Of course, we of the Dismal Rage are already aware of this, but I am sure Sir Lucan D'Lere knows nothing as usual. I have a mission for any evil shadowknight of Innoruuk.||||||
30771|freporte|Raltur_Caliskon|say|You have done well. This is the Bayle List. I have heard of it. It is useless without the remaining two parts. Take the list. You must collect the other two pieces of the list and take them to a scribe by the name of Rathmana Allin. He can be found in the deserts of South Ro. First, you must go ask Venox Tarkog what the Bayle List is. He is here in the shrine and will fill you in on your mission.||||||
30772|freporte|Rigg_Nostra|say|Excellent I've been waiting for the Coalition to send me some assistance. I have an associate waiting for some supplies that have not yet been collected. I need you to acquire a crate of pick heads and a bundle of hardwood shafts and bring them to me so that I may prepare them for delivery to my associate.||||||
30773|freporte|Rigg_Nostra|say|Thanks  $N.  Now hand this crate to the fellow behind you.||||||

30774|freporte|Rolfic_Gohar|say|To assemble Dismal Warrior Greaves you will need to obtain two bricks of crude iron and smelt them in a forge with a Water Flask and this Crude Greaves Mold. Once that is done combine the Crude Iron Greaves with two Low Quality Coyote Pelts and two Desert Tarantula Femurs in the Mail Assembly Kit.||||||
30775|freporte|Rolfic_Gohar|say|I see now we have similar interests. I will help you get outfitted in an affordable suit of armor to help you in your endeavors. You will need this Mail Assembly Kit to aid you in the construction of the armor. The materials required depend on the armor section you desire to craft. Do you plan to construct a dismal warrior helm, a dismal warrior bracer, dismal warrior gauntlets, dismal warrior boots, dismal warrior vambraces, dismal warrior greaves, or a dismal warrior breastplate.||||||
30776|freporte|Sir_Artanis|say|By Marr, what is this? .. Burning Dead .. .. Marnek! By my blade this must be stopped! Where did you find this?||||||
30777|freporte|Sir_Artanis|say|It was a fine and valiant steed to serve its master beyond the grave, but it looks to be near its end. But I have a fine eye for horses, and I dare say it will serve you one more time.||||||
30778|freporte|Tohsan_Hallard|say|As I promised, some silver and of course, the Highpass lottery ticket. Oh yes, I forgot to mention the ticket was for last season's lottery. Ha Ha!! You now own a losing Highpass lottery ticket, lucky you! Ha!!||||||
30779|freporte|Tovan_Tenlah|say|Ready to get to work are you? Listen carefully. Outside Freeports South gate you will find one of our employees, Rigg Nostra, who is acting as an intermediary between the Coalition of Tradefolk and some recently acquired business associates. Give him this card so he knows I've sent you and he will give you further instructions. Do not mention any of our names in public. The Freeport Militia would likely impose high taxes on the Coalition if they found out about the goods being exchanged to us by our new associates.||||||
30780|freporte|Tovan_Tenlah|say|Sharpen this dagger and take it with this gem and a rattlesnake skin to Verona Rankin.||||||
30781|freporte|Tykar_Renlin|say|Ahh!! That was good. Now where were we?. Oh yes. My friend Zimel is a fellow beggar. He was locked up in the arena. They were going to let him go when the Freeport Militia came for him. Ha!! He is crazy as a troll now. I took this blanket from his cell before I was released. I no longer need it and my guilt has reached its peak. I do not want crazy old Zimel to freeze. Perhaps you can return it to him.||||||
30782|freporte|Venox_Tarkog|say|Here we find a new follower.. Here we find a tunic of the Dismal Rage. Put the two together and let the hate grow. Let it be known from now on that your soul belongs to the Prince of Hate, Innoruuk. It is his power which flows within you. Destroy all those who oppose us. Please introduce your hate to the others in this shrine.||||||
30783|freporte|Verona_Rankin|say|I'm sure you could find a tailor in town to make you some silk thread or you can make your own with 2 Spiderling Silk.||||||
30784|freporte|Verona_Rankin|say|Ah, Tovan sent you for a suit of traders clothing. I can instruct you on how to prepare your suit of clothing but you will have to acquire the required materials yourself. Use this Curing Kit to construct the clothing once you have done so. Do you wish to prepare Coalition Trader Gloves, Coalition Trader Boots, a Coalition Trader Bracer, a Coalition Trader Cap, Coalition Trader Leggings, Coalition Trader Sleeves, or a Coalition Trader Tunic?||||||
30785|freporte|Verona_Rankin|emote|%s secures the gem into the hilt of the dagger and crafts a grip from the rattlesnake skin. 'Here is your new dirk,  $N. Congratulations.||||||
30786|freporte|Wenden_Blackhammer|emote|%s begins to fiddle with the hilt, gently pressing the gems into place. It seems to take forever as you watch in silence. Wenden slowly places the last gem in place and gently bends the settings to hold the gems before he hands it back to you. 'That's a very impressive looking hilt there. The material it is made out of seems strangely familiar,' Wenden says as he turns back to his forge and his other work.||||||
30787|freporte|Wenden_Blackhammer|emote|%s works his magic with his forge as you have never seen done quite like this. The bending and shaping to repair the hilt is only something a master of his art could even fathom to try. Once the hilt has been cooled in a near by bucket of ice cold water, he checks it for balance and resonance before handing it to you.||||||
30788|freporte|Wenden_Blackhammer|say|Where in the world did you drag that up?!' He peers closely at the severely damaged dragon head hilt. 'This metal is the same material that some mages use to make powerful golems and this other metal looks like rejesiam ore. If you can find some of those materials, I can fix this hilt up easily.||||||
30789|freporte|Winda_Lylil|say|Ah yes! This is exactly what I am looking for, dear. Let me put these on the shelf right away. Here is some coin for your trouble. Perhaps we can do business again sometime.||||||
30790|freporte|Winda_Lylil|say|Oh, wonderful fresh bread! Thank you for making the trip, that is such a long way. Here, I hope this covers your travel expenses. You have my deepest thanks.||||||
30791|freporte|Xelha_Nevagon|say|Let's see here. One.. two.. three.. and.. four. Great!! Just enough for my needs. You are serving Xelha well. I give you Xelha's Sparkler. It is not much, but neither are you. You know what I really need is a cyclops eye. That would be worthy of a great reward.||||||
30792|freporte|Xelha_Nevagon|say|This is a good sight. I needed these to complete the current mixture. Bah!! I shall reward you for this small, very small, deed!! I pass on to you the knowledge of summoning. The more you serve, the more your faith in Innoruuk grows.||||||
30793|freporte|Xelha_Nevagon|say|Excellent work! You are quite the little helper. Here you go, then. A little something for your little work. Your service to me has caused Innoruuk to look upon you favorably. Your faith in our group has grown. Continue the work.||||||
30794|freporte|Xelha_Nevagon|say|A cyclops eye!! You are stronger than I believed. You will rise in the ranks of the Dismal Rage quickly with acts such as this!! I am most appreciative! Here, take this. It was lying around my shelves, just gettingg all dusty. I hope you can use it. And watch yourself in your journeys, the aura of your faith in Innoruuk surrounds you like a shroud. Our enemies will surely see you for what you are.||||||
30795|freporte|Zenita_DRin|say|Why I will be.. You got it!! I thought I took it out of the deck. Very well. You win the Spare Lens fair and square. Here you are. Now get out of my sight.||||||
30796|freporte|Zenita_DRin|say|Let see what card you pulled.||||||
30797|freporte|Zenita_DRin|say|I see you have drawn the card that best represents a $R such as yourself. You lose!||||||
30798|freporte|Zhem_Xecia|say|So you think you are ready to face the enemies of the Dismal Rage? Be careful to not be blinded by your arrogance or anger. You must focus the rage in your soul and refine it into patient and insidious hatred. A cleric of the Sentries of Passion, Ulia Yovar, has been attempting to uncover our allies among the citizens of Freeport and is believed to be in hiding in the sewer tunnels under the western quarter of Freeport. Seek this enemy of the Dismal Rage and bring me her head.||||||
30799|freporte|Zhem_Xecia|say|I see your mission was a success. Take this Rough Dismal Flail and refine it in forge with a sharpening stone. It may take you several attempts if you are unfamiliar with the process. Once that is done take the Refined Dismal Flail and a Giant Rattlesnake Skin to Jerra Renlock. She will put the finishing touches on your new weapon.||||||
30800|freportn|a_minnow|emote|%s darts into the jar, or just darted past it!! The Knights of Truth do not tolerate people attempting to catch these fish!!||||||
30801|freportn|Bondl_Felligan|say|WOW, thanks! This must be worth a fortune! I could drink for a month after sellin' this to one of them fool merchants. I'm going to see how much I can get for it right now!||||||
30802|freportn|Caskin_Marsheart|say|Welcome to the guild. here's your guild tunic. Now. let's get to work.||||||
30803|freportn|Celsar_Vestagon|say|If you require the binding of wounds you should speak with Palious Jartan in the temple. He will be glad to help you.||||||
30804|freportn|Celsar_Vestagon|say|You have done well. The Marr Minnow shall have a greater chance of flourishing. Please take this as a reward.||||||
30805|freportn|Edwardian_Holyblade|say|Well for quite sometime the Freeport Militia has become more and more corrupt. They have been known to do any dastardly deed you can imagine which includes harming and sometimes killing followers of Marr. There is a group of Militia Soldiers in the commonlands that have been recently harassing a good friend of mine. His name is Pardor and he is a shopkeeper in the commonlands. As if it wasn�t dangerous enough in the commonlands he know has these Militia soldiers demanding he pay them a tax that does not exist.  Will you travel to the commonlands to kill one of these militia soldiers? I fear for my friend's life.||||||
30806|freportn|Edwardian_Holyblade|say|Your dedication to the Temple of Marr is unquestioned  $N.You have made your house very proud. May this blade bring you the best of luck and good fortune wherever your adventures may take you.||||||
30807|freportn|Eestyana_Naestra|say|You must be the young member of the Hall of Truth who was sent by Theron. I am glad to see you avoided any interference. Please take this as a reward for your service.||||||
30808|freportn|Eestyana_Naestra|say|Thank you, defender of Karana! We have heard rumors of the followers of Bertoxxulous gaining knowledge of our knight who infiltrated the ranks of the Militia. They would have tried to sell the information to the Militia. We will inform our knight immediately. As for you, here is a donation to your journey's expenses. Stay clear of the Freeport Militia. There is no doubt they have learned of your alliance with us.||||||
30809|freportn|Eestyana_Naestra|say|The Truthbringer welcomes you into his life. Here is the tunic of Marr. Wear it with pride and be sure to conduct yourself with valor.||||||
30810|freportn|Falia_Frikniller|say|Heh, that good for nothing fool. I've been here for over a month already, and I haven't seen him yet. Bah, anyway, could you take this back to him for me? It was our grandfather's lucky necklace. He passed it down to our father, and now onto my brother. Knowing that little worm, Grenny, he'll probably trade it for a mug of ale. Oh well, thanks for delivering the letter, friend. Good day to you, and safe travels.||||||
30811|freportn|Gern_Tassel|say|These are quality muffins! You are obviously quite a skilled baker. Here is your payment as promised. Now I can get back to business again.||||||
30812|freportn|Gern_Tassel|say|Oh, wonderful fresh bread! Thank you for making the trip, that is such a long way. Here, I hope this covers your travel expenses. You have my deepest thanks.||||||
30813|freportn|Groflah_Steadirt|say|I am afraid I have some bad news, Steel Warrior. I had one of my workers take the raw blades out to be engraved by the Rivervale craftsmen. On his return, he was killed by the orcs in the Commonlands. The orcs now have the blades in their possession. I believe they have a camp nearby in the Commonlands. You may still be able to find all four blades within their camp and return them to Larn Brugal. Good Luck.||||||
30814|freportn|Groflah_Steadirt|say|I heard you were on your way back. Here then. Let us sharpen that blade for you. There you are. That should be much better in a fray now.||||||
30815|freportn|Groflah_Steadirt|say|Where did you find this? This was the main price list of Zimel's Blades, but it should be all burnt up. I was at Zimel's right after the fire and I did not see it hanging where it should have been. The entire inside was gutted and . . . wait . . . the sequence of the dots!! Hmmm. I cannot talk with you here. Meet me at the Seafarer's by the docks at night. Give me the note when next we meet.||||||
30816|freportn|Gygus_Remnara|say|Welcome to the Sentries of Passion. We are the protectors of the Temple of Marr. Wear our tunic with pride, young knight! Find your wisdom within these walls and in the words of our priests. And remember to aid all who follow the twin deities, Mithaniel and Erollisi Marr.||||||

30823|freportn|Jemoz_Lerkarson|say|Bless you, my child. Marr is grateful, as are we. Here is our thanks. Let it bring you greater strength to defeat the Militia. Go and continue the crusade. Soon you will be strong enough to slay the true organizer.||||||
30824|freportn|Jemoz_Lerkarson|say|We heard of your assault. We even attempted to slay Lucan. Alas, we failed. You have done your part and as such have earned our thanks. Beware of the Freeport Militia. They will no doubt be on the lookout for you. May Marr protect you. Perhaps you should speak with Valeron Dushire, paladin of the Knights of Truth. He seeks other to slay the fallen knight.||||||
30825|freportn|Kalatrina_Plossen|say|Zimel's Blades?! Hmmmmm. It doesn't ring a bell and the remainder of the writing is too hard to make out. It kind of looks like a list of prices. You know, down at the Office of the People they might be able to tell us if this place exists. Go speak with Rashinda. She knows all about Freeport. If Zimel's Blades existed, you must report back to me what happened to it.||||||
30826|freportn|Merko_Quetalis|say|If you require the binding of wounds you should speak with Palious Jartan in the temple. He will be glad to help you.||||||
30827|freportn|Merko_Quetalis|say|You have earned the token of bravery. Now you must ask yourself if you are ready to face true fear. You will have but one chance. If you feel you are powerful enough to easily slay that desert tarantula, then hand me both tokens earned and you shall face the Test of Truth.||||||
30828|freportn|Merko_Quetalis|say|Go to the open sewer across the way. Inside you shall find your opponent. Victory shall bring your final token. Return it to me.

30829|freportn|Merko_Quetalis|say|You have performed well. You have shown your allegiance to truth and cast aside the Freeport Militia. The militia will surely despise you from now on. This is how they treat the Knights of Truth. Beware. The followers of Marr stand alone in this city.||||||
30830|freportn|Palious_Jarten|say|May the valor of Mithaniel Marr burn brightly in our soul!||||||
30831|freportn|Plur_Etinu|say|May the unbridled passion of Erollisi Marr flow through your body.||||||

30834|freportn|Salinsa_Delfdosan|say|Deisnak is a high ranking officer in the Freeport Militia, some would even call him untouchable. I need you to retrieve my newsletter for me by all means necessary. It had some very important messages from Qeynos and I must have it. Return to me with my newsletter and two Pristine Scarab Eyes and I will reward you greatly for your efforts.||||||
30835|freportn|Salinsa_Delfdosan|say|I knew that Deisnak would still have this! This has more useful information to us here at the temple then you could imagine. I am very happy to see that you were able to get it back for me. For your tireless devotion to our House I would like to present you with this mace. It has brought me good fortune in all the days that I carried it, I only wish that it can do the same for you. Good luck Knobinshu, and thank you.||||||
30836|freportn|Sentry_Andlin|say|My thanks to you. I feel much strength. You may take the bottle to the next sentry.||||||
30837|freportn|Sentry_Boris|say|Ahhh!! That has given me back lost energy. Thank you. Please take this to the next sentry.||||||
30838|freportn|Sentry_Gallius|say|Excellent!! I feel quite refreshed with but a sip. You may take this to the next sentry.||||||
30839|freportn|Sentry_Janeal|say|I feel quite alert now. Thank you. You should take this to the next sentry.||||||
30840|freportn|Sentry_Meighan|say|Very good. Nothing more than a sip and I feel much more alert. The next sentry awaits you.||||||
30841|freportn|Sentry_Theo|say|That gives me new life. Take it to the next sentry.||||||
30842|freportn|Sentry_Warren|say|Thank you. I believe you need to seek out Sentry Xyrin. She is not at the temple. I believe she left to speak with Sisterhood of Erollisi. She was to speak with Styria.||||||
30843|freportn|Serna_Tasknon|say|It is not my duty to see to the wounded. You must seek out Plur Etinu. He is in here somewhere.||||||
30844|freportn|Serna_Tasknon|say|I thank you for your ten gold coins. Now we can pay the weekly oxygen tax imposed by the militia. Here is the shark powder.||||||
30845|freportn|Serna_Tasknon|say|I see Tonmerk has found a use for my shark powder. We agreed to this trade when last we met. Unfortunately, I am out of it. If you desire the shark powder you will have to get me three shark bones. I wish you luck. Oh. I also require a payment of ten gold pieces. The taxes in Freeport are fierce.||||||
30846|freportn|Serna_Tasknon|say|The Sentries of Passion informed me of your journey to the Ocean of Tears and the demise of Sentry Xyrin. You performed beyond the call of duty. This is what makes an exceptional person. Take this for your great deed. The twin deities would wish it so.||||||
30847|freportn|Sir_Artanis|say|It was a fine and valiant steed to serve its master beyond the grave, but it looks to be near its end. But I have a fine eye for horses, and I dare say it will serve you one more time.||||||
30848|freportn|Sir_Artanis|say|By Marr, what is this? .. Burning Dead .. .. Marnek! By my blade this must be stopped! Where did you find this?||||||
30849|freportn|Sten_Harnak|say|I am very pleased to hear that you will be able to help us. The warbeads that I require will be found on specific Orc Chieftans. I am sure they are not alone and are well guarded so make sure you bring companions with you that are well proven on the battlefield. Bring me the warbeads of Chief Fosloas, Diedridan and Kelleru. I look forward to seeing you soon.||||||
30850|freportn|Sten_Harnak|say|I knew I could count on you  $N! The defeat of these high ranking orcs will definitely be a positive turn in our constant battle of ridding the commons of these vile creatures. For your dedication to the Choir of Lore I would like to present you with this blade. May it keep you safe and serve you well wherever your journeys may take you.||||||
30851|freportn|Theron_Rolius|say|If you require the binding of wounds you should speak with Palious Jartan in the temple. He will be glad to help you.||||||

30853|freportn|Tholius_Quey|say|Welcome to the Priests of Marr. Here, you will be taught how powerful passion truly is. The passion of Erollisi Marr, the Queen of Love, shall flow through you and into all those you meet. Wear this tunic in the name of Love.||||||

30857|freportn|Valeron_Dushire|say|Hail, adventurer! I... what's this? Where did you get this? Never mind.. I.. I never thought we would find him!||||||
30858|freportn|Valeron_Dushire|say|Praise be to Marr!! You have done the impossible!! Sir Lucan is finally sent to the higher courts of the Tribunal. The city now has a chance to prosper. The Hall of Truth has been redeemed and gives you thanks. Take this, it is the Sword of Faith. May you wield it with righteousness. Beware of the remainder of the militia. They will be hunting for your head.||||||
30859|freportw|Arinna_Trueblade|say|I am in need of some assistance to craft a special sword that I would like to present all graduates of my training like yourself with. However. I don't have all the pieces I need to make one. If you could retrieve a Pristine Giant Scarab Leg, one Lion Paw and one Vial of Smoke I will have all I need to create this weapon. I would have no problem presenting you with the first if I was able to create it. See you soon.||||||
30860|freportw|Arinna_Trueblade|say|Your determination to further your training and knowledge never ceases to amaze me. I knew I could count on you to retrieve these items for me. Luck was also on my side because I was able to craft the blade we spoke of before. May it protect you in all of your battles that await you. Excellent work $N.||||||
30861|freportw|Armorer_Dellin|say|Welcome to the Freeport Militia. As a reserve member we require you to wear this tunic and fight when, who and wherever Sir Lucan commands, no questions asked!! There is no turning back!! Remember to keep clear of North Freeport. You have made a wise decision. Hail Sir Lucan!!||||||

30864|freportw|Driana_Poxsbourne|say|Ahh wonderful work  $N Here is the substance....don't spill it HAHAHAaahhahehehe...yes......you don't want to spill that heheh.||||||
30865|freportw|Glyssa_Sonshaw|say|Ah..yes, I have seen this symbol before. There is a kobold that lives among the gnomes of Ak'anon. He may be reluctant to speak with you but you have no need to fear him. He is a follower of Brell Serilis and a valuable source of information on kobold society and culture. I will construct a message for him. Deliver the message and necklace and perhaps he can enlighten you to its meaning.||||||
30866|freportw|Guard_Alayle|say|This is not good news. I must leave immediately. Here. Take this to Kala.. I mean my father. I found it on the floor of Sir Lucan D'Lere's quarters. Thanks again, messenger. I got this just in time.||||||

30867|freportw|Hemia_Skemner|say|You have done the world of magic a great justice,  $N.||||||
30868|freportw|Hyrill_Pon|say|Peh! He thinks this old skull he found is a legendary skull of Wun Toque. It is said, a wizard who possesses one is granted power and intelligence far beyond those of his peers. Yiz was searching for the skulls missing ruby eyes. It seems he found the location of the first eye. Hmm.. Lynuga.. Lynuga.. I think I have heard that name before.. Yeah! Now I remember. I met her in the Foreign Quarter of Neria.. um.. Highpass Hold. She was trying to hawk some stolen gems! I think she mumbled something about going home to Grobb. I sure don't have time to track her down.||||||
30869|freportw|Hyrill_Pon|say|You found it!? My sap of a brother was right after all! I sure don't want that thing. It sends shivers down my spine just holding it. Here. Take it!||||||
30870|freportw|Hyrill_Pon|say|'Hmmm. On second thought, I might be able to get a good price for this in Neria... um... Highpass Hold. See ya, chum!||||||
30871|freportw|Janam_Rekish|emote|%s scribbles out a note and says, 'Please make sure that Harkin gets this right away. If you lose it, it could mean both of our heads.'||||||
30872|freportw|Joshua|emote|%s dips his emaciated hand into the bucket and brings the water to his mouth. As he does, you hear a soft thump from outside and notice that through the window his sister has collapsed. A glimmer enfolds her body, and you notice the water in Joshua's hand gleam a pure, bright light for a moment. 'Thank you, sir. I hope my sister returns soon. I feel better for some reason.'||||||
30873|freportw|Jyle_Windshot|say|Thanks, friend. I have run a long way to get here in time. Mostly at night. I lost my lantern in a card game in Highkeep.||||||
30874|freportw|Klom_Jysun|say|I had a student not too long ago that trained with me for quite sometime. He showed a lot of promise on his way to becoming a Grandmaster, however one day he came to tell me that he intended on joining the militia. I told him that I did not feel that was what he wanted to do but he insisted. On the day that he left he stole a headband from me that I was presented with by the Hall of Truth. This headband meant a lot to me, if you were able to find Firansad I am sure he will have it. Return it to me with two Orc Toes and I will surely reward you for your trouble.||||||
30875|freportw|Klom_Jysun|say|Your dedication to the Ashen Fist is unquestioned. I can see this by your willingness to assist me in whatever task I assigned you. I would like you to take this as a symbol of my gratitude.||||||
30876|freportw|Lady_Shae|say|Thank you. Pandos has been telling me to try white wine forever. I mostly only drink red wine. Pardon me for getting off track. Anyway, it is a good thing you showed up. The lady in room 2 has been receiving mail from a Dark Elf. You need the mail for room two. The Innkeeper usually holds it for the guests.||||||
30877|freportw|Larn_Brugal|say|Good work,  $N. The bunker shall be well stocked. Here you are, my friend. Take this raw blade. You can take it to Groflah - he will sharpen and polish it for you. It should be a formidable weapon.||||||
30878|freportw|Linadian|say|Grand doing business with you. Hold your nose. I can never get rid of the Orc stench of the vests. That is why the other merchants do not pay me much for them.||||||

30881|freportw|Lorme_Tredore|say|Ah. Thank you for bringing this to me! I will make very good use of it. Here take this small token of my appreciation in return. Guard Jenkins will no longer require it as he was killed on the training field yesterday. Tsk. tsk. tsk.||||||
30882|freportw|Nusk_Treton|say|Grand and fantastic!! You have made my day complete. Here is what little I can offer. Most of my money goes into my research. Thank you.||||||

30885|freportw|peasant_woman|say|Aye, water, m'lord. For my brother. He is very sick. He's needin' drink. He's burnin' up. I am sick myself but still able to move, a little. I must take this water to him before he gets worse.||||||
30886|freportw|Ping_Fuzzlecutter|say|I encountered a particular mermaid with beautiful hair!! She had beautiful golden tresses. I used a lock of her hair to create the Mane Attraction. That was a while back when I was in Faydwer.||||||
30887|freportw|Ping_Fuzzlecutter|emote|%s smiles broadly as he rifles through the bag, then looks up at you and says, 'Bout time! Here is the coffin as promised.'||||||
30888|freportw|Ping_Fuzzlecutter|say|You are a good helper. Here you go. One genuine, charismatic, lady magnet, zero to hero making Mane Attraction!! Guaranteed to lower prices world wide. Guaranteed to last forever.. Err.. Well,.. It has a 1000 year warranty at least.||||||
30889|freportw|Plagus_Ladeson|say|You have seen Milea Clothspinner!! This is great news. I wish I could travel to see her, but Cain will not allow me to do so at this time. You must take her a note for me. Here, take this to her. As a master in this order, I command you to do so immediately. Go!!||||||
30890|freportw|Plagus_Ladeson|say|Oh my! Opal? She is providing these agents of Neriak with information regarding the Acedemy's secrets. I can not tell Cain about this. He will be furious. Show this to Toala. She will know what to do.||||||
30891|freportw|Plagus_Ladeson|say|The Steel Warriors have no cause to dislike you, but you have yet to prove your worth to this guild.||||||
30892|freportw|Plagus_Ladeson|say|Your head shall look grand mounted on the wall of the Steel Warriors Arena!!||||||
30893|freportw|Puab_Closk|say|Welcome to the house of the Ashen Order. We are a small guild of monks who have devoted our lives to refining our minds, souls, and physical beings to their maximum potential. Please see Brother Torresk as soon as you get a chance. He is in charge of helping our newer members begin their training. Good luck,  $N.||||||
30894|freportw|Puab_Closk|say|You have performed a great service to one who is your brother. Your loyalty shines brightly, as does your skill. Take the treant fists. They are yours now.||||||
30896|freportw|Reyia_Beslin|say|You have proven yourself a mighty warrior. I am honored to present you, $N, with the orange Sash of Order.||||||
30897|freportw|Reyia_Beslin|say|Great job, $N ! Congratulations. With the destruction of these evil items, the wand of the Burning Dead will never bring harm to anyone on Norrath again. It is my honor to present to you, on behalf of Master Closk and the Ashen Order, the red sash. May Quellious be with you always.||||||
30898|freportw|Romiak_Jusathorn|say|Greetings, I am Romiak Jusathorn, Master Enchanter of the Academy. Take this.. it's our guild robe it will help protect you in this harsh environment. Now, let's get to work!||||||
30899|freportw|Shana_Liskia|say|I have a trinket that was given to me by my mother a long time ago. Before she died I told her I would always keep it close to me. Recently, some militia officers came in to our academy and confiscated anything that appeared to be valuable. Fearing for my life I did not fight to keep the necklace my mother gave me. The officer that took it was named Teridsan. If you should find him you have my permission to kill him if that's what it takes to get my necklace back. Return to me when you have my necklace along with 2 Lion Teeth.||||||
30900|freportw|Shana_Liskia|say|I am so happy to have my necklace back! I cannot begin to tell you how much this means to me  $N. Please take this dagger as a symbol of my sincere thanks. It was presented to me by the academy for my years of teaching but I hope you will take it. Good luck to you and come back to visit us soon!||||||
30901|freportw|Sir_Lucan_D-Lere|say|So I see you decided to bring me the message. Good. I would hate to have to hunt you down. It could have gotten really messy and I hate reading bloodstained messages. Well it seems Antonius Bayle and the Knights of Truth have begun an alliance. And it sounds as though I may have a traitor among my guards. If you wish to switch your allegiance to Freeport, then find me this traitor. Bring me his militia tunic. Try to keep the blood from staining it.||||||
30902|freportw|Sir_Lucan_D-Lere|say|So, it was Alayle! He was of no importance to us. He knew nothing. I thank you for assisting the Freeport Militia. My men shall keep an eye out for you. Unfortunately, so will the Knights of Truth. Might I suggest you spend less time in North Freeport?||||||
30903|freportw|Swin_Blackeye|say|Here you go then.||||||
30904|freportw|Tara_Neklene|say|Very fine work, my young apprentice. This shall be very useful in understanding their ways. I have heard rumors of a scribe who can decipher these scrolls. He is said to frequent the local taverns. Bah!! If I cannot decipher them, no one can!! Continue with your work. Soon you shall advance enough to test the might of the orc oracles.||||||
30905|freportw|Tara_Neklene|say|Wonderful! You have survived the might of an oracle. With this we can now continue our experiments. Now you may continue your teaching and study the power to summon those of earth, air, water and fire.||||||
30906|freportw|Toala_Nehron|say|Why, that little trollop! What is she up to? Cain will never believe this! She must be in league with some faction of the dark elves, but why? Neither the Academy of Arcane Science nor Cain will believe this note. I will see what I can do. As for you, I command you to kill this Shintl and her dark elf courier Hollish!! Put their heads into this box and combine them. We shall cut the link. Bring me thier heads.||||||
30907|freportw|Toala_Nehron|say|Good work!! We will soon catch Opal. I have started to formulate a plan to stop her. When I complete it, I shall notify you. Here. Take this small reward. I am sure killing Shintl was no trouble. She was just a halfling.||||||
30908|freportw|Toala_Nehron|say|The Steel Warriors have no cause to dislike you, but you have yet to truly prove your worth to this guild.||||||
30909|freportw|Toala_Nehron|say|Your head shall look grand mounted on the wall of the Steel Warriors Arena!!||||||
30910|freportw|Toxdil|say|The gem!! I would notice it's sparkle anywhere!! I cannot believe you are handing it back to me!! What a fool. Here you are fool. You can have this worthless key now.||||||
30911|freportw|Toxdil|say|Here is your snake venom. May you... shall we say... apply it to good use.||||||
30912|freportw|Velan_Torresk|say|Good work,  $N, you've worked hard and proven yourself a valuable addition to the Ashen Order. Here's your white sash, wear it with pride.||||||
30913|freportw|Velan_Torresk|say|Ah, well done,  $N. You have proven that you are a very skillful fighter and it is an honor to have you as a member of the Ashen Order. On behalf of Master Closk, and under the watchful eyes of Quellious, I present you,  $N, with this, the yellow Sash of Order. Go out and make us proud.||||||
30914|frontiermtns|92118|emote|%s hands you a shackle and removes the coppernickel shackle so he may flee. He places your shackles on his wrists and darts into the darkness.||||||

30915|frontiermtns|a_human_skeleton|emote|%s begins to crack and disintegrate, its body collapsing into a pile of dust that scatters into the winds. On the ground you notice a locket on a fine, thin chain which you pick up.||||||
30916|frontiermtns|a_sarnak_spy|emote|%s scowls at you, clearly unimpressed by your efforts. 'Of course you'll go get the report fool, but do you think that the courier will just give to you?' The sarnak shakes his head sadly. 'Okay, look. Go into Droga and try to get a warlord's insignia off one of the goblins in there. Take this forged note to the courier I've written out, along with the insignia to Warslik's woods and give it to the courier. With luck, he'll believe you work for Skargus and give you the report. If you get the report, find Gragbar and give it to him.'||||||
30917|frontiermtns|a_sarnak_spy|emote|%s reads the note slowly, turning it around in his claws a few times before completing it. 'I see you spoke with that half-wit goblin! I hate hate hate it when he sends me a note, his penmanship is almost illegible. I hope he informed you of the situation, he's really not the most dependable agent of Di'zok, and sadly his note doesn't really make much sense. No matter though, are you ready to proceed in this mission?'||||||
30918|frontiermtns|Mentrax_Mountainbone|say|Eh, you actually found one! Thank you,  $N. Here is a block of ore for you. Just don't let the other giants know.||||||
30920|gfaydark|Aliafya_Mistrunner|say|There have been numerous attacks mounted lately by the orcs of Clan Crushbone. With their stronghold ever so close to us it is feared that a full-scale attack could level our city and at the very least, leave many of our bretheren dead by the hands of the filthy orcs. What I ask is that you bring me the detailed battle plans that only the highest ranking orcs could be carrying. Bring me these battle plans along with 2 pairs of Crushbone Battle Beads and I will surely reward you for your trouble.||||||
30921|gfaydark|Aliafya_Mistrunner|say|There was no doubt in my mind that you could be counted on for this important mission. I will see that our tacticians get these battle plans so that they can be studied at once. Please take this Scimitar as a symbol of your dedication to your house and your god. You have done well, young Kiliak, may Tunare guide you always.||||||
30922|gfaydark|a_drunkard|say|Thank you kind sir <hic>, I am most grateful for your generosity.||||||
30923|gfaydark|a_drunkard|say|This is a sad day, but it was the just thing to do. The Nybright name will no longer be tarnished. Here you are my friend. This is a bit uncared for, but it is yours. My warrior days are over. Now go. I must be alone.||||||
30924|gfaydark|Bidl_Frugrin|say|Oh my!! I forgot I had that. Here you are. You better take it back I need to go elsewhere, bye now.||||||
30925|gfaydark|Bilrio_Surecut|say|You have succeeded in your quest for the kilij!! Wield it proudly.||||||
30926|gfaydark|Dill_Fireshine|say|Fantastic work!! Your actions shall earn you the respect of all Fier'Dal!  Take this as a small bounty for your deed.  We have heard of Crushbone allies who wish our demise.||||||
30927|gfaydark|Dill_Fireshine|say|Yes. A recent report has proven this to be true. An evil alliance has been made. We shall soon need many more experienced adventurers such as yourself. For now, take this reward and strengthen your skills.||||||
30928|gfaydark|Dill_Fireshine|say|Good work. We shall cut off correspondence between these two. It is for the best. Remember, if you find any notes to Neriak from the ambassador in Crushbone, give them to me.||||||
30929|gfaydark|Expin|say|I told you not to tell me.||||||
30930|gfaydark|Expin|say|Good work, scout!!  You have earned this reward.  It is all we have at the time.  I am certain you are satisfied.  If not, then do not let me hear of it.||||||
30931|gfaydark|Expin|say|Ahhh! You found it! Here let me make you a copy and put this in a secure spot so I don't lose it again.||||||
30932|gfaydark|Faelin_Bloodbriar|despawn|self||||||
30932|gfaydark|Faelin_Bloodbriar|emote|%s reads the note carefully and growls to herself. 'Bad news, eh? Take this ring. There is one elf, dark elf even, whom we must go to in order to gather insight into Innoruuk's plans. Giz X'Tin, he goes by most commonly. Kithicor seems to be his favorite haunt and most likely you will find him there. Don't ask how I know him. Just take the ring as my sign to him and he will speak to you. We don't need to speak again, so don't seek me out. Just go to Telin. I must leave to investigate these events.'||||||
30933|gfaydark|Gallin_Woodwind|say|Good!!  We have enough young warriors hunting in our woods. Your duty shall be to take this pack to the ocean and seek out sharks. Fill the bag with shark meat and combine it. I shall reward you with a fine piercing weapon.||||||
30934|gfaydark|Gallin_Woodwind|say|Very good. This meat will supply our warriors with much strength. We have found the meat from sharks to be quite nourishing. Here, then, are your wages and your weapon. All of Kelethin appreciates your great deed.||||||
30935|gfaydark|Geeda|say|Fine work. We are very grateful. Take this Scout Cape. May you use it to serve Kelethin.||||||
30936|gfaydark|Heartwood_Master|say|Welcome! We are the Soldiers of Tunare, the sworn protectors of Faydark. I thank you for joining our cause, we can always use the help. Here, put on this tunic, and let's get started.. you have much to learn.||||||
30937|gfaydark|Heartwood_Master|say|You have done well, child! Take this as a blessing from Tunare for doing her will.||||||
30938|gfaydark|Idia|say|Take this letter to Felisity Starbright. You can find her at the bard guild hall. I'm sure she will compensate you for your trouble.||||||
30939|gfaydark|Idia|say|More mail - you have done us a noteworthy service!  Please take this gold for your troubles.  If you are interested in more work, just ask me.||||||
30940|gfaydark|Innkeep_Anisyla|say|Oh, these look delicious! No doubt they were made with fresh fruit grown locally I can tell by the aroma. You have quite a talent! Thank you so much. Here is your payment. This should be enough to last me for a little while.||||||
30941|gfaydark|Innkeep_Anisyla|say|Excellent, I see you made it back safely. Thank you so much, here is your payment as promised. Now I can get back to business as usual.||||||

It appears he must have broken off a piece of it. I believe it belongs in Kaladim. You may take it, but I am sure your master will not be satisfied until you combine the final piece with this one.

It is written in some obscure code or language.  I can't decipher it, but I know someone who can.  Seek out one called Eldreth, an Erudite who used to do work for me.  I know not where he may be found these days, only that he will not be found in Erudin, as they want his head for some misdeed in the past.  Give him the complete parchment, and tell him I sent you.  He owes me.||||||

31119|highpass|Stanos_Herkanor|say|Very well done.  I leave now to confront Hanns with this evidence.  Even so, it will not be easy to regain his trust.  That is why I need those daggers, in case all else fails.<chuckle>   Bristlebane grant me luck - I can no longer live like a hunted dog.  In any case, I am grateful for your aid.  Take this wretched blade, I can bear it no longer.    I must warn you, I feel it carries Innoruuk's curse all who are near it learn the meaning of hate. <chuckle>  Ironic, isn't it?  You went to all that work to redeem yourself for a rapier, yet the true reward came when you redeemed another. <chuckle>.  Good luck, $N, for much as I, you will need it.||||||

31120|highpass|Stanos_Herkanor|say|Let me see what you have here. Aha, so that's who.. yes, yes! There is one more thing I need you to do. This document tells me who the originator of the plot really was. His name is General V'ghera, which is interesting, as Anson's men have spotted him in Kithicor recently. He will not be easy to get to, but if you give this box to one of his many aides, the General will HAVE to come to investigate. You see, this box used to contain the tools crafted for the assassination. When he arrives, kill him! I need any documents you find on him - with luck it will be enough evidence to convince Hanns that what I say is true. Bring any documents or dispatch cases you find, along with those blades Vilnius made you work so hard for, and we will make a trade.||||||

31173|kael|Fjokar_Frozenshard|say|You have found what I was unable to. King Tormax's protection of Wenglawks will end soon. His death will be so very delightful to invoke. 'rushes out of the room, dropping his spear as he does.'||||||
31174|kael|Gleed_Dragonhunter|say|My, you do have a hunters spirit! If you could track down Vluudeen and slay him without the aid of my bow, you must be worthy. Take the bow, huntsman. Use it to slay others of Vluudeen's kind.||||||

31185|kael|Kellek_Felhammer|say|It's hard to believe a $R like you is going to make a trip like this. I don't envy you little fool.||||||
31186|kael|Kellek_Felhammer|say|I still cannot believe we are giving such a prized possesion as the Collar of the Storm to a mere mercenary. You better pray you don't bring shame upon the smith who created and enchanted this item. Oh and here is your seal as Helssen has ordered me to give you. It is proof of your service to us.||||||
31187|kael|Kyenka|say|This beast must have taken quite a force to slay. These boots have been crafted to reward your kind for such great efforts. Take them and wear them with pride. They will be a warning to other dragons that you are a great slayer of their kind.||||||
31188|kael|Kyenka|say|You serve the crown well,  $N. This is one less beast to ruin our lands. Take these pauldrons which I have fashioned from the first dragon scales brought to King Tormax's court.||||||
31189|kael|Noble_Helssen|emote|%s takes the report from you and places it in a pocket without even glancing at it. He says, 'Do not worry,  $N. I know of the planar creatures who eliminated my troops. The fault is not yours but of that fool Drioc's. The Savage land is not just a simple forest as those idiots in the field believe. It is a cradle of life and the forces that drive it. Within that forest is a nexus, a gateway to another plane of existence, the Plane of Growth.'||||||
31190|kael|Noble_Helssen|say|Excellent choice, $R. Competence and a sense of style. When we are ready to take the Wakening I will most definitely welcome your participation. Here is your reward.||||||

31197|kael|Staff_Sergeant_Drioc|emote|%s takes the note and begins reading. Seeing a certain passage, he squints and rereads, his brow furrowed. He glances over at you and says, 'Very well. I will assign you a squad lead by Corporal Hlash. They will rendezvous with you out in the field. Oh and take this back to Krofer.'||||||
31198|kael|Staff_Sergeant_Drioc|emote|%s reads over the report, his face begins to turn red with anger. Drioc shouts, 'How can this be?! I sent you a squad of some of our best trained men and you had them destroyed!! This was supposed to be a routine raid and you return in FAILURE!! I would crush you under my boot right now if I wasn't so angry but I think I'll send you to my finacier. YOU can explain what happened and why his investments have been lost. Now take your carcass out of here!'||||||
31199|kael|Svekk_Fangbinder|say|Ahh, a Velium torque!  Here, I'll give you one hundred pieces of gold for that!'  Svekk places the torque in his pocket and drops some coins at his feet.||||||

Listen,  $N, you're the one that wanted to help them out, I'm just here working for Wenglawks.  I can get most of these supplies ready but I have no source for Klezendian Crystals.  I will start bundling the more mundane items Bekerak wants.  If you find any Klezendian return to me with the crystal and this voucher.||||||
31201|kael|Svekk_Fangbinder|emote|%s heaves a large pack from a pile in the corner and sets it before you.  'I wish you luck in your endeavor, $R'||||||
31202|kael|Svekk_Fangbinder|say|Did you travel to the crystal caverns to get that crystal,  $N?  You are quite brave for a $R.  I have the other supplies ready for your trip, they are quite heavy but I think you will get by.||||||

31204|kael|Vkjor|emote|%s looks down at you, shocked. 'I honestly did not expect you to be able to destroy her children,  $N. Vkjrog must have guided your hand as you slew those beasts. Nevederia will now know sorrow the like of which she has never felt.' Vkjor drops a shiny pair of gauntlets on the ground before you as he turns his attention to the bloody claws he now holds.'||||||
31205|kael|Vorken_Iceshard|say|So, the beast was still alive! Now I may rest easier knowing my dreams are only dreams and not a prophecy of his return to finish me off. The king will surely hear of your deeds,  $N. Take this belt as a token of my gratitude.||||||

31206|kael|Vorken_Iceshard|say|Congratulations, mercenary. You have earned your precious reward. Tell me, did Ekelng whine like his father for forgiveness, or did he die like a true Kromrif warrior?||||||
31206|kael|Vorken_Iceshard|say|You need to prove your dedication to our cause before I can discuss such matters with you.||||||
31207|kael|Wenglawks_Kkeak|say|I will curse your immortal soul if you fail,  $N. In the depths of the icy waters of the cobalt scar lives an outcast siren who preys upon her own kind. We have a deal, I will provide her with an excellent hunting net and she will provide me with a giant cloak made of the scales of her kind. Take this voucher to Kellek and deliver the net. Do whatever it takes to get my cloak.||||||

31210|kael|Wenglawks_Kkeak|say|He has reconsidered the offer, you say? This is most excellent! I hope this will be acceptable payment for your troubles,  $N. My cash situation is not the best at this point in time. I do have a third client who needs delivery...||||||
31211|kael|Wenglawks_Kkeak|say|It is truly a sight to behold. This is the most fashionable cloak I have yet to see. Even King Tormax will be green with envy. This old bag has served me well, I hope you find it to your liking.||||||
31212|kael|Wenglawks_Kkeak|say|So you are the mercenary I have been hearing about! Not what I expected. Anyway, here is your reward. Carry it well. Also, this noble's seal will prove your loyalty to anyone who is skeptical.||||||

31214|kael|Yetarr|say|The death of this one must be causing great strife amoung the Coldain. Your work is greatly appreciated. I wish I could reward you with more, but these boots are among the few things I have to give.||||||
31215|kael|Yetarr|say|Take these gloves and continue to strike fear into the heart of the Coldain.  A daring raid upon Icewell Keep itself deserves no less.||||||
31216|kaesora|a_tome_keeper|emote|%s drops a tattered tome at your feet and says nothing more. You pick it up and place it among your things.||||||

King Kazon sent the entire Irontoe Brigade to retrieve an ancient artifact from an old dwarven outpost.  The battle was fierce.  At its end, only a handful of Irontoes made it back.  After that, the Irontoe Brigade survivors left Kaladim for good.  All except Tumpy Irontoe.||||||

Not only is this work the responsibility of the lord of hatred alone. For some reason we cannot know the lord of disease has decided it worthy of his time to work in conjunction with Innoruuk. The spirits of the three main continents, Faydwer Antonica and Kunark, have been corrupted. Look for the corrupted forces of the land and heal them. When you have found them all then take my scimitar and the spirits to Xanuusus.'||||||

31600|paineel|Antus_Shelbra|say|Ah, it seems as if he was not a very cooperative kitty. So much for family. Oh well, take this token change as a show of my appreciation. Cazic-Thule shines on you in all his glorious fear this day, young one.||||||
31601|paineel|Atdehim_Sqonci|say|Excellent work,  $N. You are well on your way to proving yourself worthy to serve Cazic Thule.||||||
31602|paineel|Auhrik_Siet-ka|say|Of course you do. Now, listen carefully. It may be too much for your feeble mind to gather all at once, and I hate to repeat myself. Bring me one bat wing, one rat ear, one snake egg, and one fire beetle eye. Take this bag, and make sure it's sealed before you return it to me. Snake eggs spoil. Now, quit staring at me with your jaw hanging open like a dead codfish. I would have mistaken you for one, but dead codfish smell better. Haha!||||||
31603|paineel|Auhrik_Siet-ka|say|Why are you giving this to me? Oh I see. I forgot that rats don't know how to read. Haha! Well, then. I shall read it for you. You do understand common don't you? Haha.||||||
31604|paineel|Auhrik_Siet-ka|say|Well, that wasn't so hard, was it? I suppose I must now thank you for your services. Now, leave me to my studies. I would tell you what I needed the items for, but that would just cloud your fragile little mind. Off with thee!||||||

31607|paineel|Azzar_Habbib|emote|%s gasps in astonishment 'You...you..found my hat!! This is the most I can repay you but perhaps I can reward you further for some other tasks?'||||||
31608|paineel|Azzar_Habbib|say|Here is your dreadful cap as I have promised.||||||
31609|paineel|Coriante_Verisue|say|You are welcomed into the fold.  Now go out, and prove yourself, young one.  You have much to learn about the Dark Truth.||||||
31610|paineel|Coriante_Verisue|say|Very good, young acolyte. Maintain your diligence in your duties and you will quickly learn the secrets of the Dark Truth.||||||
31611|paineel|Davorre_Bloodthorn|say|Only a few years have passed and her heart has already forgotten me. No doubt she has found another to warm her bed. Go, find her new lover, and bring me nothing less than his head.||||||
31612|paineel|Davorre_Bloodthorn|say|Apparently her choice in suitors has drifted to the most pathetic of wretches ever to slither Odus. You have done well, child. I ask of you one last task before my message to Veisha is complete. Here, deliver this to her with my most sincere regards.||||||
31613|paineel|Davorre_Bloodthorn|say|My revenge has been satisfied. Thank you, my child. You have proven yourself to be a most worthy asset to our cause. Here, I no longer have any use for this, my ties to the old life are now severed.||||||
31614|paineel|Duriek_Bloodpool|say|Yes, most unfortunate. I was informed last week of the death of my most recent apprentice. A few months ago, I paid a substantial sum to a group of rogues sent from Neriak to collect on a gambling debt. He swore to me that was the end of it, but I suspected otherwise. My warnings of gambling with the rogues fell on deaf ears.||||||
31615|paineel|Duriek_Bloodpool|say|Thank you. Now, quickly, there is not much time for me. What I tell you here now must never be shared with another soul. I have spent the better part of my life piecing together clues for the creation of a legendary dark blade, a corrupted Ghoulbane. I am very close to understanding the method used in manipulating the enchantments of the Ghoulbane, but in my current condition, I cannot finish collecting the research. My previous apprentice was searching for this last clue when he met his untimely demise.||||||
31616|paineel|Duriek_Bloodpool|emote|%s gasps at you in astonishment, his eyes beaming with pride, and says, 'You've found it! It seems I underestimated you. You have succeeded where others failed. I feared it would never come to pass.' Duriek takes the key from his neck, softly muttering some words, and places it in a previously unseen keyhole. The book's hinges creak as Duriek pulls it open. After reading for a few moments, he says, 'It is even better than I had hoped! It will take me weeks to uncover a portion of what this book has to offer. But this is what I have been searching for, so many years! At last I know the items required to corrupt that accursed blade!'||||||
31617|paineel|Duriek_Bloodpool|despawn|self||||||
31617|paineel|Duriek_Bloodpool|emote|%s takes the Ghoulbane and places the other swords on either side of it. The sheath begins to gleam so intensely, you can see the bones inside Duriek's hands. After several minutes, there is a final, blinding flash. Duriek collapses to the ground. After a few moments, Duriek motions you closer and whispers, 'You have done well. I wish fate had been kinder to me and allowed me your aid years ago||||||
31618|paineel|Dzan_Amo|say|Very good young one. Here is something to assist in your studies of the principles of terror.||||||
31619|paineel|Ernax_the_Scholar|say|Hmmm. That's a phrase I have not heard for some time, and one I thought I would not hear again, any time soon. So another fool seeks Azrax's legacy, eh? Well, so be it. Take this and follow its instructions. When you are finished reading and scribing, give it back to me.||||||
31620|paineel|Ernax_the_Scholar|say|For your sake, I wish you a quick and painless death. For mine, I wish you a slow and painful one, as a warning to any fool who wishes to follow in your path.||||||
31621|paineel|Faratain|say|To assemble Fell blade Vambraces you will need to obtain two bricks of crude bronze and smelt them in a forge with a Water Flask and this Crude Vambrace Mold. Once that is done combine the Crude Bronze Vambraces with an Intact Kobold Pelt and two Calcified Humerus Bones in the Mail Assembly Kit.||||||
31622|paineel|Faratain|say|Well done  $N. I will have this translated immediately so that it may be studied. Take this Dull Fell Blade Cutlass and sharpen it in a forge with a sharpening stone. It may take you several attempts if you are unfamiliar with the process. Once that is done bring me the Sharp Fell Blade Cutlass, a Large Briar Snake Skin, and a Petrified Eyeball and I will put the finishing touches on the weapon.||||||
31623|paineel|Faratain|emote|Faratain fashions a grip from the large briar snake skin, fastens the petrified eyeball to the pommel of the hilt, and polishes the blade with a shimmering black substance. I present you with your Fell Blade Cutlass. May it serve you well in the name of Cazic Thule.||||||
31624|paineel|Gerot_Kastane|say|At last! I have been waiting for my brother for weeks! We are doomed! Innoruuk will taint our seed into some perverse, twisted, maddened breed. The prophecy has begun to unfold and there are none capable of stopping it. Quickly, return this note to Marl, we must hide! We have failed the master! We must escape the hateful one's wrath!||||||
31625|paineel|Gerot_Kastane|say|Good travels, dark one! May Innoruuk curse your enemies!||||||

31629|paineel|Guard_Menbuknar|say|Uggggg. Take dis keyz.||||||
31630|paineel|Keletha_Nightweaver|emote|%s takes the note, dumps the dust into her hand and examines it for a moment. She looks up and chuckles 'It's amuzing how one of our Royal Guards cannot identify this substance. Do you feel how it's slightly cooler than other metals? It's called Permafrost Iron, also known as Cold Iron to laymen. Miragul wrote of it's properties in his memoirs. There are much better metals at our disposal now, so it's use is rare except in more primitive cultures. Here is my report.'||||||
31631|paineel|Librarian_Kesler|say|Take this book.  $N.  It contains the history of the ancient city from which we came.||||||
31632|paineel|Mandaril_Dark_Knife|say|You are welcomed into the fold.  Now go out, and prove yourself, young one.  You have much to learn about the Dark Truth.||||||
31633|paineel|Miadera_Shadowfyre|say|Yes! Can you feel the terror in the air, prickling your flesh, and standing your hair on end? The chanters have summoned the avatar of Terror! Quickly take this mundane mask to him and he shall forge it into a valuable symbol to be worn by loyal apostles of Terror!||||||

31634|paineel|Nivold_Predd|say|Commendable work, you have proven yourself a valuable member of our order. Our chanters have summoned the avatar of Dread. Hurry and take him this mundane shield so that he may forge it into a truly valuable symbol of your devotion to the lord of Fear!||||||
31634|paineel|Nivold_Predd|spawnunique|75194|474|1230|-37|128||
31635|paineel|Noclin_Saah|say|Ah! You found him and obviously removed his presence from the yard. You have my thanks, small as it is for such a menial task. Here. Keep this worthless bit of bone for your labors.||||||
31636|paineel|Royal_Guard_Sheltuin|say|Then you will deliver this chest for us. Don't worry about what's inside it. Although we enjoy our solitude, we do make allies. We also make use of those allies. We will do so now. Take the chest to Lyris Moonbane below the human city of Qeynos. You will then follow her instructions and complete any tasks she assigns you. In return, she will send you back with what we wish. Fear is our armor.||||||
31637|paineel|Royal_Guard_Sheltuin|say|Hmmm. Very odd. The dust in the crate implies some sort of stone was transported in it. Perhaps our brothers of the Arcane will be able to find out where this dust came from and what it?s used for. Take this dust sample and note to Keletha Nightweaver. She will examine the dust and send you back with a report. Make haste.||||||
31638|paineel|Royal_Guard_Sheltuin|emote|%s's eyes redden with intense anger after reading the report. When he speaks, his voice is suprisingly calm and measured. He says, 'Listen close $R. When you leave this building, you will find the courier who is bringing the ore. You will kill him, and collect his head and a box of the ore. You will then find the supplier, and collect his head and any other information you find on him. Bring me these four things and you will be rewarded. Do not fail.'||||||
31639|paineel|Royal_Guard_Sheltuin|say|Honestly  $N, I thought you would not return. Such strength and intelligence in a Knight of Fear I have not seen for quite some time. Wear this in pride of the ancient Ridossan. Perhaps when you are ready, I will give you a more important task. This conspiracy must be stopped.||||||
31640|paineel|Royal_Guard_Sheltuin|say|Well done,  $N! Now we need only wait for the kobolds to start dying off and our plan will be complete. Should only take 8 years or so. One such as yourself will wear this ancient armor well. The Tunic of the crusader Rodossan is now yours.  He shall watch over and praise you in your triumphs... your defeats on the other hand... well, never mind that.||||||
31641|paineel|Sadorno_Chomosh|say|The Tabernacle of Terror has many enemies here on Odus who oppose our teachings to our patron deity, Cazic-Thule. The priests of Prexus and Quellious in the city of Erudin seek to purge Odus of our kind, for they view us as a disgrace to the Erudite race. Behind their disdain, however, lies fear. It is this fear that allows us to prosper and become more powerful than the closed-minded fools of Erudin. In the Toxxulia Forest, you will find such a fool, a priest named Terago Omath. This priest attempts to ward the Toxxulia Forest from the presence of the undead.  Seek this Terago Omath and return to me with his head.||||||
31642|paineel|Sadorno_Chomosh|say|Ah, it appears you have learned to control your fear while ridding us of another fool.  Very well done. Take this Cudgel and return to me after sharpening it in a forge, along with a large Briar snake skin, and a petrified eyeball.||||||
31643|paineel|Sadorno_Chomosh|say|Very good work. Here is the Cudgel, use it well!||||||

31647|paineel|Sern_Adolia|say|Excellent Job  $N. These components will help with our research immeasurably. You will soon be reaping the rewards granted by our Lord Cazic-Thule!! If you want to further assist our research effots, talk to Atdehim Sqonci.||||||
31648|paineel|Shevra_Kollintar|say|Ah, excellent work.  I certainly had my doubts about you,  $N.  Wear this well.||||||
31649|paineel|Shwara_Volerno|say|To craft an Abattoir Initiate Robe you must obtain three silk thread. two woven widow silks. and two giant briar snake skins. Once you have the necessary components combine them in your Curing Kit with this Tattered Robe Pattern.||||||
31650|paineel|Shwara_Volerno|say|Well done  $N.These parchments will be inspected immediately by some of The Abattoirs most experienced translators and researchers. Take this Rough Abattoir initiate Staff then go forth an obtain a Giant Briar Snake Skin and a Petrified Eyeball. Once you have done so bring me those items and the rough abattoir initiate staff and I will put the final touches on what will be your new instrument of power.||||||
31651|paineel|Shwara_Volerno|emote|%s fashions a grip out of the Giant Briar Snake Skin, fastens the Petrified Eyeball to a steel mount on one end of the staff, and tarnishes the wood of the staff with a shimmering black substance. 'Here is your new Abattoirs Initiate Staff,  $N. May it serve you well in your pursuit for power.'||||||
31652|paineel|Taralani_Rahnta|emote|%s beams the brightest smile you've ever seen in this dark place at you when you tell him you accept his offer. He quickly hands you the satchel and takes the platinum eagerly. As you leave, you swear you hear chuckle at something.||||||

31663|qcat|Bruax_Grengar|say|A Staff of the Bloodsabers is a useful implement for young sorcerers dedicated to Bertoxxulous the Plague Lord. I will assist you in the creation of a staff but first you must complete a task for me. The sorcerers of The Order of Three are supporters of Antonius Bayle IV, the haughty ruler of Qeynos. They lend magical aid to the Knights of Thunder and Priests of Life to identify and capture members of the Bloodsabers. A rather troublesome member of The Order of Three, Larkin Tolman, has recently been spotted at a settlement in the Western Plains of Karana. Find this Larkin Tolman and bring me his head.||||||
31664|qcat|Bruax_Grengar|say|Well done. The Bloodsabers have many enemies within the city of Qeynos and its surrounding regions. You must exercise much caution when not within the safety of our temple here in the Qeynos Catacombs. Take this Rough Bloodsaber Staff and when you have gathered a Giant King Snake Skin, two Gnoll Fangs, and a Giant Fire Beetle Eye, return them to me with this staff and I will complete its construction.||||||
31665|qcat|Bruax_Grengar|emote|%s smooths the shaft of the staff, fashions a grip from the giant king snake skin, secures the giant fire beetle eye in a metal fixture and attaches it to the top of the staff.

31673|qcat|Illie_Roln|say|Ah, so you are in need of a suit of armor fitting a young scourge warrior of the Bloodsabers. I will assist you.

31676|qcat|Kurne_Rextula|say|Incredible!! You have slain one of the greatest warriors in Qeynos!! He must have been full of grog. No doubt he drank most of his skill away. Now I shall cast a spell and strip the flesh from his skull and.. Presto!! Take this skull to Lord Grimrot somewhere in the Plains of Karana. He will be in the center of a field of skeletons. If he is not there, wait for his return. He must return eventually.||||||

Her eyes widen as she carefully opens the chest, revealing a pile of platinum coins and a small note. After admiring the coins she takes the note and reads it.

31679|qcat|Lyris_Moonbane|emote|%s's eyes light up with childish glee as she takes the jar containing the disgusting and deadly substance. From her pouch she removes a gob of putty and a gem carved into the likeness of a flying insect. After sticking the putty to the lid of the jar, she mashes the carved gem into the putty and hands the jar back to you. She then says, 'This is enchant the substance. You must then deliver the substance.||||||
31680|qcat|Malka_Rale|say|Ok! I am trusting you. Take this pouch to Vilnius in West Karana. Last word I had from him, he was hanging out near one of the bandit camps. Be careful, since he does not know you. Just give him the pouch, and tell him I was..delayed. While you are doing that, I will be thinking of a way to get out of this slimehole. With any luck, the Circle will learn the pouch is out of Qeynos, and will assume I got away. That means they won't be looking for me here.||||||
31681|qcat|Nomaria_Doseniar|say|Good work, child of the plague. Now take this forged note to Te'Anara of the Jaggedpine Treefolk. Be sure to watch your back, now. The guards of Qeynos surely know who you are by now. They will not stop to ask questions.||||||

31686|qcat|Rocthar_Bekesna|say|The Priests of Life and Knights of Thunder often travel the roads from Qeynos carrying messages for the farmers of the Plains of Karana and the Knights of Truth in Freeport on the opposite coast of Antonica. We have recently been sending Bloodsabers to the Plains of Karana in search of a possible location for a new hidden temple should the need arise. One of the messengers of the Knights of Thunder has alerted the peasants of the plains the possibility of a Bloodsaber presence there and is using them to track our motions. Find the messenger, Lukas Hergo, and bring me his head.||||||
31688|qcat|Rocthar_Bekesna|say|Well done  $N. Now take this Rusty Scourge Warrior Broadsword to a forge and sharpen it with a sharpening stone.

Be mindful of your words when not within the walls of this temple. The Qeynos Guards would execute you for your allegiance to the Bloodsabers.||||||
31697|qcat|Unmuz_Tukore|say|Excellent, the Knights of Thunder must learn that by beginning an inquisition of the Bloodsabers they are effectively declaring war. Take this Rusty Scourge Knight Saber to a forge and sharpen it with a sharpening stone. It may take you several attempts if you are unfamiliar with the process. Once that is done take the Tarnished Scourge Knight Saber and a Giant King Snake Skin to Wellis Pestule and he will put the finsihing touches on the weapon.||||||
31698|qcat|Vin_Moltor|say|Ah. Come to ol'Vin my dear sweet Kalish.. Mmmm.. And Rat Ear Pie.. I am going to eat and drink like a KING! Huh? Oh.. The Paw.. Here you go.. Hope it brings you more luck then it did me..||||||
31699|qcat|Wellis_Pestule|say|To assemble a scourge knight breastplate you will need to obtain four bricks of crude iron and smelt them in a forge with a Water Flask and this Crude Breastplate Mold. Once that is done combine the Crude Iron Breastplate with a Medium Quality Wolf Pelt, a Decaying Sternum, and a Decaying Ribcage in the Mail Assembly Kit.||||||
31700|qcat|Wellis_Pestule|say|Welcome to the Bloodsabers young Scourge Knight. I will help prepare you for your spreading of the disease. You must use this Mail Assembly Kit to construct the pieces of your armor. Each piece will require different materials for its construction. Will you craft Gauntlets of the Scourge Knight, Boots of the Scourge Knight, a Bracer of the Scourge Knight, a Helm of the Scourge Knight, Greaves of the Scourge Knight, Vambraces of the Scourge Knight, or a Breastplate of the Scourge Knight?||||||
31701|qcat|Wellis_Pestule|emote|Wellis Pestule fashions a grip out of the giant king snake skin, sharpens the edge of the blade to be razor sharp, and polishes the weapon with a strange blood like substance.||||||
31701|qcat|Wellis_Pestule|say|A fine weapon for a Knight of the Bloodsabers. Go now and spread the Disease!||||||
31702|qcat|Xeture_Demiagar|say|Hmmm. Another rat has found its way to my doorstep, huh? Well, we may have use for you. Go find Rihtur, maybe he has an errand for you.||||||
31703|qcat|Xeture_Demiagar|say|You have done well,  $N. Take this Rusty Bloodsaber Mace to a forge and clean it up with a Sharpening Stone. It may take you several attempts to get all the rust off if you are not familiar with the process. Once that is done take the Refined Bloodsaber Mace to Torin Krentar with a Giant King Snake Skin and he will put the finishing touches on the weapon.||||||

And now, you have learned the wisdom to act in our best interest. However, one last path awaits, to determine if you have the ability to act out what must be done. There are many troubles about the world we try to rub out but none is more serious than the curse on what the wasichu call the Emerald Jungle. Go there and find one of our spirits. Show them the gem you have been given and follow the path they set you on.||||||

31706|qey2hh1|a_wandering_spirit|emote|%s nods somberly and takes the items. After a moment, he says, 'It is unfortunate that it came to this, but nothing else was to be done. Both paragons had lost sight of their virtures to protect the items given to them. The mere protection of these material belongings was not as important to Mithaniel Marr or Bertoxulous as it was that they act with righteousness in their minds and purpose in their hearts. You saw this and acted accordingly. For that, we will reward you with the three treasures made into one to ward off the falsehood of possession, the Shield of Falsehood. You have walked the path and now, as your final test, we must set you along one last path.'||||||

31741|qey2hh1|Vilnius_the_Small|say|Very good, though how you managed to lug around all these oversized blades amazes me. I feel we can do business now, and Malka still has not shown up. Take this dagger. I had an old client who didn't, um.. pay.. so this was extracted from him. Right after it was inserted in him. For your next job, I need a collection of robes. The Robe of the Ishva, some Shining Metallic robes, an Oracle robe, and a Robe of the Kedge. I am not even sure where all these come from, but they are on my list here, and Rokyl is one of my best clients, so I figure that is your job.||||||
31742|qey2hh1|Vilnius_the_Small|say|You do good work, $R. Here is another trinket for your trouble, you should be able to make use of it. Malka still hasn't made it back yet, and I have one more order to fill, if you're willing. This one should be easy. My sword collector has decided he wants rapiers now, of all things. He has asked for an Eyerazzia, a Martune Rapier, a Burning Rapier, and a well balanced rapier.||||||

I have been stuck here and haven't any more trinkets to give you, but perhaps you could take this pouch to its new owner, since I do not have the time to deliver it myself. He will pay you in full, and you can just keep what he gives you, how does that sound? The owner is a man named Stanos Herkanor, and he or his friend Anson are supposed to meet me in Highpass this evening. Do not waste too much time getting there, he is a secretive man, and I can not guarantee he will be around long. Good luck, and maybe we will meet again.

But what is even more intriguing is the acquisition of the scepter itself. I am impressed and these items represent your deeds better than any arrogant boasting that I hear day in and day out from the other youths of the order. Aaaah and yes, you have the scroll! Well then, we cannot let an opportunity like this slip through our fingers, now can we?'' The mage quickly eyes the scroll before closing his eyes and beginning an arcane chant. The scroll in his hand begins to smolder, although the page is not damaged. A glowing silver image of a swirling storm seems to reflect off the surface of the parchment. Then, the scepter begins to slightly chime and runes begin to magically imbed themselves into the scepter's base. The mage opens his eyes and extends the scepter to you, ''Now then, shall we continue?||||||

This was simply a ploy to steal money and I do not take kindly to that.

31799|qeynos|Fish_Ranamer|say|Taxes?! Taxes?! Tax me right out of business is what you folks are doing! Take your taxes and get out of my pub! Unless, of course, you care to buy some drinks...?||||||

31801|qeynos|Gehna_Solbenya|say|If you need to be healed, I suggest you speak with the Priests of Life. You can find them in the Temple of Life on the other side of Qeynos. The only service you can pay for here is holy armor. Daedet Losaren charges followers of Karana for that blessing.||||||
31802|qeynos|Gehna_Solbenya|say|You have done a good service for the flock of Karana. Study the words upon this scroll and soon Karana shall keep you from thirst.||||||

31809|qeynos|Guard_Kwint|say|Hey. Thanks! Sorry about that 'he's my brother' bit but I am sure you had a good time at the Lion's Mane anyway. I sure didn't lie to you about the quality of the ale there.||||||
31810|qeynos|Guard_Lasen|say|Oh, thank you so much!' Lasen brings the drink to his lips and ravenously drinks the bottle's entire contents, ' Aaaaah. Here, please take this reward for your kindness.  Also take my advice, do not go exploring beneath Qeynos unless you bring friends.  I have seen too many like you enter the aqueducts alone, never to return.||||||
31815|qeynos|Hansl_Bigroon|say|I would be pleased to help out such a noble organization. Here you are, my good friend. See you at weekly services!||||||

31817|qeynos|Juegile_Sohgohm|say|I have heard word that there are numerous gnolls in the hills terrorizing a good friend of mine Rephas. I need you to go to the hills and assist my friend Rephas. Rephas had 3 pages of research he was studying and they were stolen by these gnolls. I need you to retrieve these pages and bring them to Rephas. He will then give you a completed book to return to me. Bring me back the completed book from Rephas and I will surely reward you for your efforts.||||||
31818|qeynos|Juegile_Sohgohm|say|I knew I could rely on Rephas to finish this research for me. We both know that this would not have been possible without your help young  $N .

31826|qeynos|Kasine_Paegra|say|You have returned an Order of Thunder which has been drained of all its power.  I wonder how this could have happened.  No doubt evil is behind this.  Thank you for its return.  I give you the blessings of Karana.  Go and serve the Rainkeeper.||||||
31827|qeynos|Kasine_Paegra|say|The Rainkeeper has bestowed this weapon with power once more. Take it and defend our temple.||||||

31832|qeynos|Lord_Mrallon|say|Aaaah, yet another warrior brave enough to face their own faults and honorable enough to strive for a proof of their worth and devotion to The Rainkeeper. Your kind is too few and far too rare, but do not think that your trials are at their end. I have forged the necessary Hollowed Tempest Stone||||||
31833|qeynos|Madame_Serena|say|Fifty gold? You must want a rune of fortune. If you want another one, give fifty gold to Mizr N'Mar in the Neriak library.||||||
31834|qeynos|Mar_Sedder|say|Here are the taxes,  $N. Boy, you call the guards and they take their time to show up but be a few days late on your taxes and they send the goons after you. Sheesh!||||||
31835|qeynos|McNeal_Jocub|say|Looking for moonstones, are we? The only way I know of getting a moonstone is to hunt gnolls for Captain Tillin of the Qeynos Guards.||||||

31846|qeynos|Micc_Koter|say|Oh yes. Now I remember.. Ha ha.. He said he was going into the Plains of Karana to look for some gnoll lover by the name of Caninel. He said Caninel knew something about the location of the Paw of Opolla. It sounds like a bunch of rat crap to me , I never heard of no one named Caninel. But off he went.. Heck , finding one person in the Plains of Karana without a  ranger  to guide you is like looking for a clean spot on ol'Klieb here. Ha ha!!||||||
31847|qeynos|Miltiades_Tal-Azroth|say|I have reason to believe that Tovax Vmar is behind this, a dreaded necromancer that has been known to prowl the hills. Having Tovax dead will surely send a message to the Bloodsabers to tread lightly for their days are numbered. If you are able to find Tovax return to me his necklace along with 2 Enchanted Wisp Globes and I will reward you with a weapon suitable for a true knight of Karana.||||||
31848|qeynos|Miltiades_Tal-Azroth|say|Your dedication to your house amazes me  $N. Please take this blade as a symbol of your loyalty to your faith.||||||

31850|qeynos|Nesiff_Tallaherd|say|Oh dear. I hope my mistake will not bring too much grief down on poor Weleth. He was told not to order arrows from me after the last time I fouled up their shipment. But Weleth knew I needed the account to stay in business. Could you please rush this new invoice to him right away? Thank you.||||||
31851|qeynos|Nesiff_Tallaherd|say|Oh.  Vesteri sent you?  Here you go.  I hope Te'Anara likes it.||||||

Everyone knows if you need to fence.. er.. find something in Qeynos, Crow is your man. He always seems to know who's missing what. I am off to get some food.||||||

Once you have returned with these items I will reward you with a weapon worthy of the finest Qeynos Songweaver. I look forward to seeing you soon.||||||
31860|qeynos|Sollari_Bekines|say|I will get this to my friend at once so that he can finish his antidote. I appreciate all you have done for me and you have surely proven yourself as a worth songweaver! Please take this blade I have forged for all graduates of my tests. May it lead you to unforeseen treasures and guard you always.||||||

31862|qeynos|Tabure_Ahendle|say|Incredible!! Such grand tones. It shall make a fine rug. You have shown me that you cannot always judge a book by its cover. You are quite skilled. Would you like to perform a dangerous task for me?||||||
31863|qeynos|Tasya_Huntlan|say|Taxes? Oh, that time again huh? Here you are. Give Vicus our best. I hear he is under the weather.||||||
31864|qeynos|Ton_Firepride|say|Away from me, fool! The Knights of Thunder are no friends of mine. They persist in forging their own armor! What?! Are not the talents of Ton Firepride to their liking?!||||||
31865|qeynos|Ton_Firepride|say|Ha! This is great. Here's your money, murderer! Hope the guards don't find you. Now get lost! Take the tunic. Maybe Garuc will reward you for such a vile deed. I sure don't want to keep it around here.||||||
31866|qeynos|Trumpy_Irontoe|say|BWAH hah hah! I knew you wasn't the loser you.. <gulp>.. <gulp>.. appear to be! I will have to tell Kane.. <burp>.. all about you. Maybe get you in the gang!||||||

We shall still require your service, Knight of Thunder. Events have transpired which put all agents of righteousness in danger. We cannot explain all as yet. Take this note to Freeport. You will give it to Eestyana Naestra at the Hall of Truth. Beware, now. The Shrine of Bertoxxulous now knows of your allegiance. Give me any other item.||||||

31879|qeynos|Yakem_Oreslinger|say|I need you to take this crate and fill it with either Small Bracks of Unrefined Ore or Large Bricks of Unrefined Ore then return it to me so that I may refine it and sell it.

31884|qeynos2|Astaed_Wemor|say|I pray to Rodcet Nife that you have made it back in time. Let's add a small amount of this honey jum to this and.. here is the potion. This potion must be taken to a sick member of the congregation. The man is Lempeck Hargrin. He lives in the west plains of Karana between the river and the crop fields. He is in dire need of this potion. He has an odd disease. We have tried everything to cure him and this is his last chance. Run to him.||||||
31885|qeynos2|Astaed_Wemor|say|It is good to know that we saved Lempeck. He has given us his scythe as a donation to the temple. We shall find a use for it. As for your fine work at preserving the life of another, I reward you with the Shining Star of Life. Should you ever desire more strength in battle, call upon it to give you strength, but let it be known that at battle's end, you shall feel weaker than before you called upon the power. Just for a short time. When the power is drained, go to our temple storehouse and ask Whysia to recharge the Shining Star of Life. Go and serve life.||||||
31886|qeynos2|Brohan_Ironforge|say|Oh! thank you! Now I know she is safe. My sweet Tayla. Here is your reward, as promised. A hero such as yourself deserves a weapon with which to uphold your noble values.||||||

Here, take this. It belonged to her mother. She always said that in times of need, it gave her courage to go on.. Thank you so much for your efforts.||||||
31899|qeynos2|Guard_Weleth|say|What was that you said? You mentioned the Sabertooths of Blackburrow? Those gnolls have caused this city trouble harm for too long. We have yet to force them from Qeynos Hills. I hear rumors of a few merchants who even dare to sell the outland Blackburrow Stout which is brewed by the gnolls. Foolish!! We call upon all citizens to assist in ridding our land of the gnolls. If you wish to join the fight then speak with Captain Tillin.||||||
31900|qeynos2|Guard_Weleth|say|Thank you so much for the favor. Please be careful here in Qeynos. I have come to suspect that even some of my fellow guards are not to be trusted - Lieutenant Dagarok, for one.||||||
31901|qeynos2|Hanns_Krieghor|say|Lucky thing you weren't followed. or you'd be breathing through holes in your back right now. Go find Knargon, maybe you can help run the next shipment. Remember, we keep our business quiet, so watch yourself, sewer crawler.||||||
31902|qeynos2|Hanns_Krieghor|say|YES! The bastard is dead, finally. I would have loved to do the work myself, but this will suffice. Here, take this, you have proven yourself a true friend of the Circle!||||||

31904|qeynos2|Kane_Bayle|say|You will be taking this with you. Give this marked bottle to a man called Barn Bloodstone. He is known to hang around a place called the Golden Rooster. He has a package for me. He will then give you instructions to your next destination. Now, be off! Time is of the essence!||||||
31905|qeynos2|Kane_Bayle|say|Good Work, friend. I still need the other parts. You'd best hope no other gets to them first and returns them to me first. If they do you get no payment.||||||
31906|qeynos2|Kane_Bayle|say|Thank you for your help. Soon Antonius' agents will be exterminated like roaches. May the virus of the Plaguebringer run through your veins.||||||
31907|qeynos2|Knargon_Lanenda|say|Hmm. Carson better deal with his little 'problem' soon, it's costing us a lot of money. Hanns is gonna skin us all when he hears this. Go tell Hanns that Carson has a mole in the Highpass guards, and see what he wants us to do.||||||

31912|qeynos2|Lieutenant_Dagarok|say|What is this? Hmmm. It seems Weleth has a problem with following orders. I will deal with him. Good work in bringing this to my attention. Our job here would be much more difficult without the help of loyal citizens like yourself. Take this as a token of Commander Kane's appreciation.||||||
31913|qeynos2|LuSun|say|Greetings, and welcome to the Silent Fist Clan. Don our guild tunic, purge your mind and soul, and begin your lifelong devotion to the Clan.

31917|qeynos2|Moodoro_Finharn|say|HA!! I hope you enjoy the book. It is missing pages 30 and 34. It is nothing more than garbage without them. A rogue ripped them from their bindings and sold them to Ran.||||||
31918|qeynos2|Nerissa_Clothspinner|say|Thank you my friend. I understand that Astaed Wemor of the Temple of Life has been concerned for my well being. Take him this note. I am sure he will reward you for easing my troubled mind.. If you are a respected member.||||||
31919|qeynos2|Nomsoe_Jusagta|say|I cannot help you with your request.   You must speak with Brother Tonmerk Plorsin.||||||
31920|qeynos2|Phin_Esrinap|say|Togahn gives out the red, purple, and blue headbands...  go ask him what you need to do to earn one.||||||
31921|qeynos2|Phin_Esrinap|say|Oh this is not good. Too many innocent traders have been getting robbed lately by those vile bandits out in the Karanas. Something must be done soon. Anyway, thank you for delivering the message... you did very well, young  $N. Here's a little something to quench your thirst from all that running around.||||||
31922|qeynos2|Phin_Esrinap|say|Good job,  $N, keep up the good work! Here is your white training headband. Wear it with honor, and make Lu'Sun proud.||||||
31923|qeynos2|Phin_Esrinap|say|Good work.. and, as promised, here is your reward. It is an honor to present this yellow headband to  $N, for recent acts of courage and heroism, on behalf of the Silent Fist Clan.||||||
31924|qeynos2|Phin_Esrinap|say|It is an honor to present the orange headband of the Silent Fist Clan to one of our finest members,  $N the mighty!||||||
31925|qeynos2|Priestess_Caulria|say|I see you have rid our land of a beast tainted with the blood of Bertoxxulous. The Prime Healer shall look favorably upon your soul. Here is our thanks and just in case the beast may have bitten you...||||||
31926|qeynos2|Priestess_Caulria|say|Oh dear. The disease has spread to the realm of the Treefolk. It must have been difficult to kill such a large and rabid beast. Here. Take one of my personal scrolls as thanks for such a brave act of devotion. I pray you can use it. If not, then perhaps one of your fellow adventurers can.||||||
31927|qeynos2|Priestess_Caulria|say|This is odd. This could explain the increase in the number of beasts within the lands surrounding Qeynos. You must take this to Freeport. Here. You must speak with Lorme Tredore. Show him this pellet. You had best gear up for the trip. Freeport is very far away. Here is some gold. Outfit yourself at our expense.||||||
31928|qeynos2|Priestess_Jahnda|say|Welcome to the Temple of Life. I am Jahnda, the High Priestess of the Clerics of Nife. Wear this tunic with pride and carry out the will of Nife. Please, see Tonmerk Plorsin or Nomsoe Jusagta. They will help get you started spreading the will of The Prime Healer.||||||
31929|qeynos2|Priestess_Jahnda|say|Oh my word!! This is terrible news. This belongs to Hayle Mool. He has been captured by the Splitpaw Clan while in Karana. You must go to his aid. We cannot do so at this time. Here. Be sure to hand him this summons. I will need to speak with him.||||||
31930|qeynos2|Quinon_Hulleaf|say|Ah, hey,  $N...  <yawns>...  Here ya go...  <yawns>...  Please excuse my yawning, but this working nights has really drained the energy out of me.  Though, it does...  <yawn>...  get interesting around here sometimes, which helps to keep me awake.  Anyway, be safe,  $N, and I'll see you later.||||||
31931|qeynos2|Reldin_Harkolis|say|A message between two of our agents was recently intercepted by a Qeynos Guardsman. The message is encoded in thieves cant but should the guards eventually decode it we would expect trouble. Guard Gregor, the guard who currently is in possession of the message is out patrolling somewhere in the West Karanas. Find this guard and recover the message. Bring it back to me when you have done so.||||||
31932|qeynos2|Reldin_Harkolis|say|Excellent! It is fortunate you recovered this message in time. Take this Rusty Unseen Hands Dagger to a forge and sharpen it with a sharpening stone. It may take you several attempts if you are unfamiliar with the process. Once that is accomplished bring me the sharpened dagger, a gnoll fang, and a large king snake skin and I will put the finishing touches on the weapon for you.||||||
31933|qeynos2|Reldin_Harkolis|emote|%s fashions a grip out of the large king snake skin, fastens the gnoll fang to the heel of the hilt, and polishes the blade with a faintly glowing polish. 'Herei syour new weapon young rogue.'||||||
31934|qeynos2|Renux_Herkanor|say|Yes, I see you aim to please. I hope you gave Lomarc the payment he deserved? Heh, that punk had no idea of the value of this shipment. The emerald inside this doll will fetch a pretty penny from those greedy merchants.||||||
31935|qeynos2|Rineval_Talyas|say|Take this book quickly and tell no one about this.||||||
31936|qeynos2|Rodgar_the_Tall|say|Wonderful!! I am sure that was a lot safer than battling a treant.||||||
31937|qeynos2|Roesager_Thusten|say|Rodcet be praised!! This is what we have been searching for! On behalf of the Temple of Life, let me thank you and offer you this small reward for your aid in our war against the Plaguebringer.||||||
31938|qeynos2|Seta_Bakindo|say|Great work  $N, we thought that was the last we'd seen of young Tomer.||||||
31939|qeynos2|Seta_Bakindo|say|There are many more corrupt guards. I am sure this is just the beginning. You have helped Konem and for that I thank you . You are well on your way to enlightenment and tranquility. I bid you farewell and wish you well where ever your travels may take you.||||||
31940|qeynos2|Sneed_Galliway|say|Hey,  $N, how the heck did Vicus convince you to do his job? He better be paying you well. Here you go.||||||
31941|qeynos2|Sneed_Galliway|say|HA! Good work! I knew you were the person for the job. A regular ratslayer you are. Here is your reward as promised. be sure you keep this between us.||||||
31942|qeynos2|Suuspa_Clanim|say|You have cleansed Norrath of another follower of the Plaguebringer. You have done well. Take this reward and continue your search for others who wear this ring.||||||
31943|qeynos2|Suuspa_Clanim|say|This is not good. Hmph. It appears they are shattered. For the first time one of our members has been swayed. I reward you for your deed. Also, if you have found anything upon Trintle, let me know.||||||
31944|qeynos2|Togahn_Sorast|say|We are deeply honored to have such great warrior as part of our Clan. With a proper burial, Shen and Dareb's souls will finally be at peace, and with the death of that vile Ghanex, the plains will be much safer for travelers. It is a great honor to present you,  $N, with the red headband of the Silent Fist Clan.||||||
31945|qeynos2|Togahn_Sorast|say|In honor of your recent acts of courage and dedication, I reward you,  $N, with the purple headband of the Silent Fist Clan.||||||
31946|qeynos2|Tomer_Instogle|say|Lead the way, and I shall follow. When we make it back, please inform Seta that you have rescued me.||||||
31947|qeynos2|Tomer_Instogle|say|Oh, you have the makings of a true hero.. The Silent Fist Clan is proud to have you as ally. May your soul guide and protect you through these chaotic times.||||||
31948|qeynos2|Tonmerk_Plorsin|say|Bertoxxulous is the vile lord of all disease. We of the Temple of Life are sworn to put an end to any being who serves the evil god.||||||
31949|qeynos2|Tonmerk_Plorsin|say|I thank you, my good friend. Surely the road to Freeport was not easily trod. Please take this as compensation for your costs and I also grant you the ability to call forth the power of Rodcet Nife to smite the enemy. Go forth to defend life.||||||
31950|qeynos2|Tonmerk_Plorsin|say|The glory of Rodcet Nife flows through your soul. May your body and soul live in righteous health.||||||
31951|qeynos2|Tonmerk_Plorsin|say|The glory of Rodcet Nife flows through your soul. May your body and soul live in righteous health.||||||
31952|qeynos2|Tonmerk_Plorsin|say|The glory of Rodcet Nife flows through your soul. May your body and soul live in righteous health.||||||
31953|qeynos2|Tyokan_Mekase|say|Oh, turning in your key, are you? Very well, defender of life. Here you are.||||||
31954|qeynos2|Tyokan_Mekase|say|I see your beads need to be charged. Very well, here you are. Use them and good health to you!!!||||||
31955|qeynos2|Umvera_Dekash|say|It's about time. Let's see here. Right.. right.. right. Very good. Right. There you are! I translated the text. Now the scrolls need to be bound. Take these scrolls to Jheron Felkis in Freeport. I believe he is staying in one of the spare rooms in Velith and Bardo's establishment. He will ensure they are bound correctly. Return to me when the binding is complete.||||||
31956|qeynos2|Umvera_Dekash|say|You have returned safely. That is wonderful! Where the heck is my book, child? In my hands, I see. Such a bright little twinkle you are! Well, let me scribble something down on this pad here. There you are. Take this note to Durkis Battlemore in the Butcherblock Mountains. He is a remarkable smith, but more importantly, he owes me for his smithing books.||||||
31957|qeynos2|Vegalys_Keldrane|say|Thank you for bringing this person to justice. Please read this manual very, VERY carefully. Commit it to memory. We do everything strictly by the book. We are a people of law and order and I simply won't tolerate a breach of protocol. Investigators are expected to accurately report findings, are authorized to issue warrants and to notarize official documents for all lands under the jurisdiction of Antonius Bayle and the council. I sincerely hope you can earn your Investigator's Badge.||||||
31958|qeynos2|Vegalys_Keldrane|say|Very well, here is the briefing document. Please read it very carefully. I wish you luck friend, this mission could prove to be dangerous.||||||
31959|qeynos2|Vegalys_Keldrane|say|Here is my personal seal. Go to the sewers and locate my investigator and show him this seal if he yet lives. Find out what happened to he and guard Helminth. Then if at all possible, complete this operation by finding Azibelle Spavin and execute her. Bring me her head and return me my seal and you shall be rewarded.||||||
31960|qeynos2|Vegalys_Keldrane|say|Good work  $N! So Guard Helminth was corrupt? So crafty are these black hearted souls that they can fool even the righteous Kane Bayle himself! I'm sure he will be saddened to hear of this. I too am saddenned by the loss of one of my best investigators. At least we've served justice this day by sending Azibelle Spavin to her dark master. May she rot with her god. Take this Badge of Honor and wear it with pride and distinction.||||||
31961|qeynos2|Whysia_Flock|say|Here you are, then.  May the power of the Prime Healer guide you through life and keep you healthy.||||||
31962|qeynos2|Whysia_Flock|say|I see your beads need to be charged. Very well, here you are. Use them and good health to you!!!||||||
31963|qeynos2|Zannsin_Resdinet|say|Great work,  $N... The Circle is very pleased with your performance of late, and as a small reward for our more trusted members, I give you this... the cloak of the Unseen Hands. It's good to know that we can count on you to get the job done... here,  $N, go relax and have some wine, on me.||||||
31964|qeytoqrg|Axe_Broadsmith|say|So you are the new warrior. Let us test your skill. Across the pond is a skeleton. See him? Engage him in combat. He awaits. Return his skull to me and I shall call you a Steel Warrior. Be quick. He will dissipate soon.||||||
31964|qeytoqrg|Axe_Broadsmith|spawnunique|4192|1055|3858|-19|||
31965|qeytoqrg|Axe_Broadsmith|say|So you have returned. Victory is yours, young Steel Warrior. Take this letter of recommendation to Brin Stolunger at the arena in Qeynos. You have passed.||||||
31966|qeytoqrg|Baobob_Miller|say|Here ya go! That should keep ya nice and warm! Be sure to tell all the friends you're going to impress where you got this fine cloak. Although I am sure they probably have heard of me already.||||||
31967|qeytoqrg|Baobob_Miller|say|They are exquisite, if I do say so myself. Hope they fit.||||||
31968|qeytoqrg|Baobob_Miller|say|I hate working with such low quality hides. They lack the sheen that makes a high quality pelt look so fine! Anyhow, here's your belt.||||||
31969|qeytoqrg|Chanda_Miller|say|Oh, good! I can make you a nice new cloak now. Here. Here. Oh, this.. it is a good one. Nice bear fur. Here you go!||||||
31970|qeytoqrg|Chanda_Miller|say|Ohh good.. good! I.. um.. can make.. Oh great. Here you go. I hope you like it. I always um.. try my best. Tell your um.. friends where you got your bear things!||||||
31971|qeytoqrg|Chanda_Miller|say|Great. Oh, here, now I can make the.. um.. ok.. here. Yes.. good. I love making bear skin belts. Here you go. I hope you like it.||||||
31972|qeytoqrg|Gnasher_Furgutt|say|Ah. Good for you! Here you are. Take this to McNeal, but next time there will be no stout if there are no weapons.||||||
31973|qeytoqrg|Guard_Cheslin|say|Oh!! Do you play Illusion, too? I love that game. I have some very rare cards in my deck. I seem to have dropped four of them somewhere during my last patrol. Darn it! They probably blew away the minute I dropped them! I will never find those cards again.||||||
31974|qeytoqrg|Guard_Cheslin|say|Oh great! I have all my cards back. Here is a little something for assisting a Qeynos guard. And any time you are in trouble, just call on Cheslin, master swordsman. Take it to my father, Master Chesgard of the Knights of Thunder in Qeynos. No doubt he sent you to follow me on my watch.||||||
31975|qeytoqrg|Guard_Leopold|say|Blast those dogs!  The Sabertooths is what they call themselves around here.  They have a nest, or whatever you call it, up there east of Surefall Glade.  We can always use help here, keeping those dirty gnolls away from our fine city.  Talk to Captain Tillin in South Qeynos and tell him you want to join the fight.||||||
31976|qeytoqrg|Konem_Matse|say|Oh I see.. Phin's always after me about something.  I mean, it's not my fault the order hasn't come in yet.  Hey, since I'm so busy right now, why don't you be a friend and take this back to Phin for me, huh?||||||
31977|qeytoqrg|Marton_Sayer|say|Baby Joseph!! Look, Momma!! Baby Joseph has been rescued by this good adventurer!! That evil Lord Elgnub made good on his word and snatched my son from under our noses. You saved the day!! For this you shall wield 'Gnoll Slayer'!! Be aware of its true potential.||||||
31978|qeytoqrg|Marton_Sayer|say|The eye and the journal! What a great day! The Gnoll Slayer shall be returned to full strength because of you. Your service to Qeynos will not soon be forgotten.||||||
31979|qeytoqrg|Neclo_Rheslar|say|Ah.. Hello friend.. So, I see Daenor sent you.. Uh huh, ok.. Here's something that will be very useful for you. Practice this well, friend.. It will help protect you in this harsh world.||||||
31980|qeytoqrg|Niclaus_Ressinn|say|Oh, things are becoming dire here in Norrath. May Rodcet protect us! I have gathered most of the evidence I will need to present to Jahnda, but I could still use your assistance with one final piece. I need to recover a rib bone from of the undead beasts that wander these hills. Be sure the rib bone comes from one of the putrid skeletons. They are the spawn of Bertoxxulous.||||||
31981|qeytoqrg|Niclaus_Ressinn|say|Excellent! Rodcet smiles upon us this day! Here, please take this pouch of evidence to Jahnda in the Temple of Life. She will know what we must do. I will remain here to keep an eye out for the minions of Bertoxxlous. Also, accept this small reward as a token of my appreciation of your efforts to rid Norrath of the influence of the Plaguebringer.||||||
31982|qeytoqrg|Rephas|say|Ahh yes..  These are a little small, but still some good eating, if you know how to cook 'em of course..   Here ya go, enjoy and may Karana keep your fields lush and green.||||||
31983|qeytoqrg|Rephas|say|Wha?..   Ah, I guess it's a bit of an acquired taste..  Oh well, your loss..  Here, take this..  They ain't no ears, but it's the least I could do..   And if ya find any more rat ears, good ol' Rephas here will be glad to take 'em off your hands for ya!||||||
31984|qeytoqrg|Rephas|say|Wow!..  How big was the dang varmint that these come off of?!  Bigger'n a ol' grizzly, I bet!  You've earned this, my friend!  It's my own secret recipe for rat ear pie..  sure is tasty, easy to make, and keeps your belly full while you're running about in the hills and such.  Take care, and may Karana keep your path clear and our lakes full.||||||
31985|qeytoqrg|Rephas|say|These were the exact pages I was missing. I have been compiling this research for Juegile. It is now finished so please bring this book to him. Thank you!||||||
31986|qeytoqrg|Rilca_Leafrunner|emote|%s takes a look at the documents you handed her and smiles, 'This is exactly what we needed. We'll be better prepared if the gnolls are foolish enough to actually attack. I hope you are willing to assist us in the defense of Surefall. Should you choose to aid us, this club will serve you well.'||||||
31987|qrg|Corun_Finisc|say|Thank you for tracking down the filthy little poacher. Take this as your reward.||||||
31988|qrg|Corun_Finisc|say|Excellent! Here is a Jaggedpine Crook of your own. Please use it only to defend yourself and never to attack one of Tunare's creatures. You will find that while wielding the crook, Tunare grants you a boon of strength and the power to smite enemies who would otherwise be impervious to physical attacks.||||||
31989|qrg|Errin_Pinewhisper|say|A poacher was recently discovered hunting the bears in Surefall Glade and Qeynos Hills. This poacher has been identified as Yollis Jenkin and it appears that he has fled to Western Plains of Karana to escape retribution by the Jaggedpine Treefolk for his murders. Find Yollis Jenkin and tell him the Jaggedpine Treefolk sent you. He is wanted dead or alive so if he resists capture then bring me his head.||||||
31990|qrg|Errin_Pinewhisper|say|It is a shame when human blood must be shed in the defense of our brother wolves and bears. I thank you for your dedication to the Jaggedpine Treefolk. Take this rusty pine scout sword and sharpen it in a forge with a sharpening stone. It may take you several attempts if you are unfamiliar with the process. Once that is done return the sharpened sword to me with a gnoll fang and a large king snake skin and I will put the finishing touches on the weapon.||||||
31991|qrg|Errin_Pinewhisper|emote|%s fashions a grip from the large king snake skin, attaches the gnoll fang to the heel of the swords hilt, and polishes the blade of the sword with a luminescent green polish. 'Here is your new weapon young ranger. May it serve you well.'||||||
31992|qrg|Frenway_Marthank|say|It is not right to feel satisfied at the sight of Mammoth's hide, but I do. Thank you,  $N.||||||
31993|qrg|Gerael_Woodone|say|Long ago, centuries before the Combine Era even, there grew a great tree upon Norrath.  It stretched to the stars and was as wide as the span of Erud's Crossing.  From the roots of this tree sprung all the woodlands of Norrath.  An unknown force struck it down.  Some say it was the great dragon, Veeshan!  Whatever the force, the Great Tunarbos was shattered.  Lost forever.  Now the wood chips lie scattered across the face of Norrath.  To hold a shard of the Great Tunarbos is to hold the hand of Tunare.||||||
31994|qrg|Gerael_Woodone|say|Oh my!! Our Qeynos Ambassador, Gash, is in danger. Please take the note over to Captain Tillin of the Qeynos Guard then find Gash and inform him they are trying to kill him. Go!!||||||
31995|qrg|Gerael_Woodone|say|So the Unkempt Druids are alive and well.  We shall keep a watchful eye out as should you.  Take this for your bravery and defense of the Jaggedpine.||||||
31996|qrg|Gillarian_Naelev|say|Fantastic work!! Hager will be pleased. Not only do we rid ourself of a poacher, but we rid the land of these destructive gnolls. Our fletchers crafted this for me... Please take it as thanks.||||||
31997|qrg|Gillarian_Naelev|say|Your deeds are great indeed. We shall cleanse our land of these poachers once and for all. A report has surfaced of a master poacher.||||||
31998|qrg|Gurrin_Nitestorm|emote|%s examines the blade carefully, his manner seeming distant||||||
31999|qrg|Hager_Sureshot|say|Welcome, we are the Protectors of the Pine. Wear this tunic of our guild, and help us defend our great and beautiful woods. Go to Larsk Juton, he will help train you and teach you the power of the woods.||||||
32000|qrg|Hager_Sureshot|say|His days of hunting are over. In the name of the Protectors of the Pine, I offer you this reward. If you are unable to make use of it, you may sell it. I suggest you hold onto it. If you are a ranger it will come in handy.||||||
32001|qrg|Jhaya_Wyndrunner|say|Excellent, my friend! Well done indeed. These are exactly what I needed to make the tunic Nolan has requested of you. And. . . thank you for avenging my dear, departed friend. She shall be missed, and it is in her memory that I give you the Jade Studded Tunic. Go now, my friend. Nolan awaits and I am sure that he will be most impressed with your success thus far||||||
32002|qrg|Jhaya_Wyndrunner|say|Excellent, my friend! Well done indeed. These are exactly what I needed to make the circlet. Go now, my friend. Cheyloh awaits and I am sure that he will be most impressed with your success thus far.||||||
32003|qrg|Larsk_Juton|say|So, I see you rid the hills of the beast. Good work! I have a reward for you. I hope it will be usefull. I am afraid this gnoll's death will not halt the alliance between the two. I shall require your services to assist in the extermination of the gnoll brewers.||||||
32004|qrg|Larsk_Juton|say|Excellent!  Ridding the area of those foul beasts will certainly slow down whatever it is they are planning.  Here is the Cloak of Jaggedpine.  You should keep this, for you never know when we may decide to alter the enchantments on it.||||||
32005|qrg|Larsk_Juton|say|Fine Work,  $N. Hmmm. It seems this needs taking care of. Take this note to the Captain of the City Guard in Qeynos. His name is Captain Tillin. He will have to attend to this matter. Also.. Let me see the gnoll\'s head. I must know you killed him. Be safe, my friend. I am sure that whoever this McNeal is, he was simply a lackey. Whoever he works for is most likely going to be looking for you. Watch your back in Qeynos.||||||
32006|qrg|Lerian_Wyndrunner|emote|%s studies the hide carefully||||||
32007|qrg|Lerian_Wyndrunner|emote|%s inspects the rib and the hide, checking for imperfections that might disable him from completing his work. Satisfied with the quality of the components, Lerian places the rib in the center of the hide, which is draped over his arm. He then begins to speak softly in an ancient, druidic tongue that is foreign to your ears and knowledge. As he speaks, the black fur of the hide seems to pierce the cartilage shark rib, binding it in-place. The rest of the hide folds back, wrapping itself around the druid's arm. Lerian then completes his chant and removes the Reinforced Rawhide Sleeves from his arm and offers it to  $N 'There is more that you must do, my friend, before this task is complete.'||||||
32008|qrg|Lerian_Wyndrunner|emote|%s studies the hide carefully||||||
32009|qrg|Lerian_Wyndrunner|emote|%s gently places the braids of pine across the rawhide bracer.  He murmurs a few soft syllables, and the braids begin to move and grow, as if of their own volition.  Wrapping around and through the blackened rawhide, the bracer is soon completely covered by the braids.  With twinkle in his eye, Lerian hands the bracer to  $N.||||||
32010|qrg|Lerian_Wyndrunner|emote|%s examines the gloves, checking the item's stability and quality of make. Satisfied, Lerian then pulls the gloves onto his hands and proceeds to carefully cover the gloves with the dark emerald moss. He then closes his eyes and begins to whisper a soft chant in an ancient druidic language as he opens the small pouch and sprinkles the fern seeds across the palms and back of his hands. As he chants, his hands hold a soft emerald radiance and the seeds begin to sprout before your eyes. The tiny ferns weave in an out of the Mithril netting, binding the moss to the gloves and creating a beautiful design upon the back of each gloves. Lerian removes the gloves as his chant ends and extends them to  $N, a delicate, warm smile upon his face in silent approval.||||||
32011|qrg|Merdan_Fleetfoot|emote|%s blinks and looks at the flower. 'This is perfect. Thank you! I'm going to go over to her now. Erm, well, maybe I'll wait a week to let the uh.. beauty of the flower.. uhm.. blossom. Yes, that sounds good. Here, you take this painting. I don't need it now. I made it myself, she wouldn't like it anyways.'||||||
32012|qrg|Merona_Castekin|say|Oh Tunare why!?!? Those foul Bloodsabers will pay for my brother's death!! Here. You have given us valuable information about a new threat to our homes. Take this a token of our appreciation.||||||
32013|qrg|Niera_Farbreeze|say|This, this is my mother's amulet. I cannot believe it. Please, take this powder you say you need. Perhaps it does have powers, I don't know, I don't care. Thank you, my eternal thanks for this.||||||
32014|qrg|Salmekia_Treherth|say|The Bloodsabers are responsible for a number of atrocities including the spreading of the diseases which have been inflicting the wolves and bears of the Qeynos Hills and the recent poisoning of the farmers fields in the Plains of Karana. Recently we have discovered that a Bloodsaber defiler has been attempting to poison the waters of Surefall Glade. Find this individual and deal with him accordingly, I doubt that this individual will surrender willingly. If need be eliminate them and bring me their head.||||||
32015|qrg|Salmekia_Treherth|say|It is a shame that some people decide to throw away their humanity with the worship of evil deities. Your actions have saved the lives of many creatures that rely on the waters of this glade. Take this Rusty Pine Druid Scimitar and sharpen it in a forge with a sharpening stone. It may take you several attempts if you are unfamiliar with the process. Once that is done return to me with the Sharpened Pine Druid Scimitar, a Gnoll Fang, and a Large King Snake Skin.||||||

32018|qrg|Te-Anara|say|Long ago, centuries before the Combine Era even, there grew a great tree upon Norrath.  It stretched to the stars and was as wide as the span of Erud's Crossing.  From the roots of this tree sprung all the woodlands of Norrath.  An unknown force struck it down.  Some say it was the great dragon, Veeshan!  Whatever the force, the Great Tunarbos was shattered.  Lost forever.  Now the wood chips lie scattered across the face of Norrath.  To hold a shard of the Great Tunarbos is to hold the hand of Tunare.||||||
32019|qrg|Te-Anara|say|Well met, friend of the forest. You will find power and enlightenment amidst these woods. Here, wear this tunic and represent the Jaggedpine with pride.

32022|qrg|Te-Anara|say|This is dreadful news. We have been nothing but kind neighbors to Qeynos. Now Antonius Bayle wishes to abuse our friendship. This will not sit well with the others. Begone, messenger!||||||

Give him the gem and perhaps he will tell you more of the spirits.||||||
32026|rathemtn|Brother_Zephyl|say|We thank you for the return of the idol of Zan Fi. Take this rare robe pattern. You shall find it useful should you aid Brother Qwinn in his quest.

I have assembled patterns that will allow you to construct some protective leather garments to keep you comfortable in the wilds and help turn aside the weapons of the Storm Reapers enemies.

The required components vary according to which piece of Thorn Mail armor you are planning on assembling. Do you wish to craft a thorn mail coif, a thorn mail bracer, thorn mail gloves, thorn mail boots, thorn mail sleeves, thorn mail leggings, or a thorn mail tunic.||||||
32058|rivervale|Blinza_Toepopal|say|Here. Take it to Lowmot. The stew is already paid for but the good Deputy usually tips Jillin quite well. Hurry! It's getting cold!||||||
32059|rivervale|Blinza_Toepopal|say|Well it is about time!  The mayor gets very upset if he does not have the freshest of carrots in his stew.  Here is the money for the carrots.  Be off with you.  Now, where the heck did Jillin go?||||||

They are working together with the goblins of Runnyeye through some twisted alliance brought forth by Lord Pickclaw to mount an attack on Rivervale. I strongly feel that this attack may be more then we can handle. If we are able to find out how they plan to attack us we can make sure that their plan will not be carried out. Once you have obtained 4 pages of war documents from these monsters return them to me and I will reward you greatly for your efforts.||||||

32074|rivervale|Hibbs_Rootenpaw|say|We Storm Reapers are searching for the culprit that is seeding the cursed fields with the diseased and undead creatures. The person responsible has committed great offenses to the ways of Karana and the people of Rivervale and must be stopped. Should you identify the individual responsible slay them and bring their head to me and you shall be rewarded for your deed. It is a shame that our otherwise peaceful lives must occasionally be interrupted by the necessity for bloodshed.||||||
32075|rivervale|Hibbs_Rootenpaw|say|Hello, friend! I am Hibbs Rootenpaw, leader of the Storm Reapers. Our guild works together with Will Tagglefoot and his family on their farm, to produce the food supply for all of Rivervale. With Karana's help, we have a bountiful harvest every season. We're glad you could help us out. Here's your guild tunic, it'll help keep you dry during the wet months. Go find Reebo out in the fields. He'll help get you started. Welcome aboard! May you serve Karana well.||||||
32076|rivervale|Hibbs_Rootenpaw|say|Excellent work young Storm Reaper. It is sad that one of our own would resort to such vile acts his mind must have been twisted by evil desires. Such behavior is practically unheard of among the kind people of Rivervale. Take this dull scimitar and sharpen it in the forge here at the Tagglefoots Farm with a sharpening stone. It may take several attempts if you are unfamiliar with the process. Once that is done give the sharpened scimitar and a large fruit bat wing to Bodbin Gimple and he will put the finishing touches on what will be a fitting scimitar for a Druid of the Storm Reapers.||||||
32077|rivervale|Jimji_Bottletoe|say|To assemble Bravefoot Mail Boots you will need to obtain two bricks of crude iron ore and smelt them in a forge with a Water Flask and this crude Boot Mold.

32079|rivervale|Kaya_Cloudfoot|say|Some days ago one of our Storm Reapers, a ranger by the name of Botim Bonker, ventured into the Kithicor Forest at daybreak on a routine patrol and never returned. That night his bloodied tunic was found hanging on a fence post of Tagglefoots Farm. The blood was dried and many hours old. We believe that he was slain during the day and that deduction coupled with the fact the undead of Kithicor do not leave the woods nor possess the intelligence or means to sneak into Rivervale and leave the tunic where it would surely be found by fellow Storm Reapers led us to believe they were not responsible. We believe it was the work of the Teir'Dal. Search the Kithicor Woods by daylight and punish the Teir'Dal responsible. Return with the villains severed hands as proof of his death.||||||
32080|rivervale|Kaya_Cloudfoot|say|Karana smiles upon you young  $N! Take this tunic to keep you warm through the storms you must face. There is evil encroaching upon the lands of Karana's faithful. The wicked minions of Bertoxxulous and the Teir'Dal children of Hate corrupt the lands to the west and east, and the Deathfist Clan of Orcs are waging war on this region while destoying the wilderness for lumber and stone. It is Karana's will that we defend our lands and way of life from these evil threats.||||||
32081|rivervale|Kaya_Cloudfoot|say|Take this Dull Bravefoot Short Sword to the forge at Tagglefoots farm and sharpen it with a sharpening stone. It may take several attempts if you are unfamiliar with the process. Once that is done present the blade and a large snake skin to Bodbin Gimple and he will put the finishing touches on the sword.||||||

32083|rivervale|Lendel_Deeppockets|say|Orcs is the job  $N. Plain and simple I cannot stand these homewreckers. They have moved into our land and continue to storm our front gate. I seek out bone fragments and fractured jawbones from these nasty Orcs. Once we have 1 of each we will be able to create a weapon for you to use.||||||
32084|rivervale|Lendel_Deeppockets|say|HA! I asked that fool Denry to send me a professional, and this is what I get?!? Oh diddlepicks! That crotchety old coot never liked me anyway. And after all I've done for him! Hrrmf! Ah well, let's get you started and see what ya got, huh, kid? Here, wear this. Maybe I'll have Toelia break you in, huh? Yeah, that'll work! Go find her, and she'll put you to work. Just remember, we all earn our keep around here, or else it's back to hay farm for you! Oh yeah, tell her you're the new dishwasher so she knows you are on the level.||||||

You have stepped up to the challenge of the Leatherfoot Raiders, you may wear the petitioner's skullcap, but to receive the true cap of the raiders, bring me the dirk of a fallen Neriak dragoon and the cap I have given you.  Only then can I be sure that you can truly be one of the few and bold, the Leatherfoot Raiders.||||||
32087|rivervale|Marshal_Anrey|say|Congratulations, my young deputy! Welcome to the brotherhood of the Leatherfoot Raiders. You have earned your skullcap. Wear it with pride. You are now one of the elite. Remember our motto, 'Those who risk, prevail'.||||||
32088|rivervale|Marshal_Ghobber|say|You can find Freeport beyond Kithicor Forest on the other side of the Commonlands.||||||
32089|rivervale|Marshal_Lanena|say|What was I thinking?!! Piranha are coming downstream and eating our supply of fish! We have never had a problem like this!!  Where are these little beasts coming from?  For now we must collect more. Take this bag. Collect enough teeth to fill the bag. Don't worry, if it takes a while I shall reward you with the Rantho Rapier.  We will need to examine the teeth.||||||
32090|rivervale|Marshal_Lanena|say|Fine work. We shall continue to study these and shall determine if we need to seek the source.||||||
32091|rivervale|Megosh_Thistlethorn|say|What forge?  Didn't you see it on the way in, young  $N?  Oh, and check with Smithy Bodbin about the sharpening stones, he usually has a good supply of them.||||||
32092|rivervale|Megosh_Thistlethorn|say|Welcome to the Storm Reapers  $N! Here is a tunic to keep you warm in your travels. Rivervale, our lovely home is facing dangerous times. From both the east and west forces devoted to the evil Gods Bertoxxulous and Innoruuk are corrupting and destroying the wilds of Norrath. Also, the Orcs of Clan Deathfist are waging war on this entire region and gathering lumber and stone for some unknown purpose. We must do our best to preserve the lands and way of life of all Karanas people.||||||
32093|rivervale|Megosh_Thistlethorn|say|Excellent work young Storm Reaper  $N. Now take this Dull Storm Reaper Machete to a forge and sharpen it with a sharpening stone. It may take several attempts to get the blade to an adequate sharpness if you are unfamiliar with the process. Once it is sharpened give it to Bodbin Gimple with a ruined thorn drakeling scales and he will put the finishing touches on what will be a fine weapon!||||||
32094|rivervale|Reebo_Leafsway|say|Very good. Very good indeed. Karana does not need the blind obedience that so many deities require. Trust your instincts, they are more often right than not. Here, take this to Blinza. Hurry, she is expecting them. You may keep the donation she gives you in return.||||||
32095|rivervale|Reebo_Leafsway|say|These carrots are rotten. They were rotten when I gave them to you. Why would you waste time and energy on such a fool's errand? Because I asked you to? Many, even those you trust will ask you to do things which you should not. Use the common sense that Karana has blessed you with to know which tasks can benefit our people and which could harm them. Learn this lesson well. You will need it if you plan to adventure beyond the vale. Now take these fresh carrots to Blinza and apologize for your error. You may keep the donation she gives you as payment.||||||
32096|rivervale|Reebo_Leafsway|say|Excellent!!  You must have taught ol' Nillipuss a great deal!  But he never seems to learn..  Oh well.  The Stormreapers and all of Rivervale owe you a debt of gratitude.  Please accept this token of our appreciation.||||||

I have been trapped in this golem of hay for many years. Ever since the horrible bloodbath in the forest I have been bound to this horrible fate, and I cannot find rest until the person responsible for my murder has been dealt with! Our fates are intertwined, you and I. We can both find peace if you listen to what I have to say. Find the blue orb. It yet retains its dark power. Go into the woods and seek out the one with a fragment.||||||

There walks amongst us a spy of the storm giants, who feeds our every move to them and their accursed strategist. For the life of us, we cannot deduce whom the traitor is, however we have received word from Wenglawks of Kael, an associate of ours, that he has information concerning this. For a measly sum of 100 platinum, he has offered to give us the information to rid ourselves of this traitor. If you are indeed friend to the kin, take this note to Wenglawks and rid us of this traitor.||||||
32116|skyshrine|#Sentry_Kale|say|You have done us a great service,  $N . I cannot believe a mere child of Zek could infiltrate our society, this whole encounter has been very frightening. Soon a time will come when we can no longer cut ourselves off from the rest of the world. Soon we will be forced to fight every day of our lives to defend our heritage and way of life. Hopefully we shall have allies such as yourself when that time comes. I would like you to have this small token of our gratitude. A venerable wurm allowed us to grace this piece of armor with his teeth when he passed on, wear it well.||||||
32117|skyshrine|Commander_Leuz|say|Very good! Take this to the scout and wait for them to return the report.||||||
32118|skyshrine|Commander_Leuz|say|Well this artifact will defently need study. Thank you for this report. Perhaps after we have researched this object more we will have more for you to search for.||||||
32119|skyshrine|Eldriaks_Fe-Dhar|say|First you must awaken his spirit by speaking where you found his corpse. You must say exactly this: 'You are one but two. Your vengeance shall find a home.'  Hopefully this will bring him to you. You must then hurry and splash the vial of Kromzek blood upon his ghostly form. The taste of the blood with bring him fully into existence. You must then do battle with him. If you defeat him, you will have split his being which will be represented by two more shades. Give them each a flawless diamond. He will comply and choose these gems as a phylactery. Once you have the dual phylactery, you need only combine them with the assembled naginata in a forge to create the Ethereal Bladed Naginata. Bring me the the weapon.||||||
32120|skyshrine|Eldriaks_Fe-Dhar|say|Hmm? What's this? Oh! You are the $R who has been helping us with the nameless one. Well, not so nameless anymore. A part of Garzicor clings to this world, eager to wreak vengeance upon the giants who murdered him. We've decided that a weapon must be constructed, and the restless spirit of Garzicor must be bound to it. You must be the one to construct this weapon. This dust must be used in the forging of the weapon's blade. Are you a master smith,  $N?||||||
32121|skyshrine|Eldriaks_Fe-Dhar|emote|%s takes the staff, blade, and tsuba and looks them over. He says, 'Excellent craftsmanship. These will make a fine weapon. But one part remains to join all the pieces together. That is the fitings.' The Wyvern then hands you the items back along with a vial of blood and says, 'This vial of blood will allow you to awaken Garzicor's spirit.'||||||
32122|skyshrine|Eldriaks_Fe-Dhar|say|You have succeeded  $N. Garzicor's spirit no longer calls to us from beyond. Now we ask that you do one more thing. You must wield this weapon against all giant kind to satiate Garzicor's thirst for vengeance. The Naginata has a special power against the Kromzek, they will fall easily before it. However, if you do not wish to, hand the weapon back to me and I'll give you an earring more worthy of a being of faith. If you are one of sorcerous powers, hand me the earring and I'll hand you a ring more suited to you.||||||
32123|skyshrine|Eldriaks_Fe-Dhar|say|Tis sad to see that the weapon will not be wielded by its maker, but here is your earring. Wear it well.||||||
32124|skyshrine|Eldriaks_Fe-Dhar|say|So you prefer the ring? Very well. May it serve you well,  $N.||||||
32125|skyshrine|Eldriaks_Fe-Dhar|say|You have decided to wield the Naginata after all?||||||
32126|skyshrine|Jualicn|say|Combine the four runes in this lexicon and you will then have the teachings of Relinar. After you have done this, you are required to speak again with Lawyla about the problems we are having with Kromzek spies.||||||
32127|skyshrine|Lawyla|say| $N, you are to be commended for your valor and determination in assisting my Kin. Here is the spell that Hsagra died so long ago over. I only ask that each time that you use the sorcery here, that you remember Hsagra in a silent prayer of thanks. For I hope that will help ease Yelinak's still tormented soul from his loss. I bid you farewell. You are welcome amongst our ranks.||||||
32128|skyshrine|Oglard|emote|%s examines the axe closely. The Wurm's eyes widen as he makes out the name of Garzicor and immediately raises his head to the ceiling, letting out a howl of emotional pain. Your bones shake with the screach, an image of a man in the midst of a rain of his own child's blood comes to mind, the agony is so great. Out of breath, Oglard drops his head and focuses his attention back to you, barely able to hold himself up. He places an urn before you and says, 'You must find his corpse. Find his burial site and summon Garzicor's spirit by speaking your remembrance of him. Speak to him and find out all you can. Return to me with 2 pieces of his corpse combined in that urn. Help us  $N, you MUST!'||||||
32129|skyshrine|Oglard|say|Thank you,  $N. With this urn, our fears are confirmed. His spirit is split, each striving for its own desire. We've decided what must be done. Your help is key in the success of our plans. If you wish to continue what you have started, please take this urn to Eldriaks Fe`Dhar. He will make known to you our plan.||||||

32130|skyshrine|Ralgyn|say|It is with great sorrow that I receive this talisman which clearly symbolizes the death of my son for he would first suffer a hundred deaths then rather then to willingly give up his only bind to his Mother. However your assistance and dedication to me is unquestioned. For your efforts I would like you to carry something very special to me. Please take this Circlet and treasure it always as it belonged to my Faliana. I feel as much as you assisted me in obtaining the whereabouts of my son I know that she would want you to have it as much as I do. Sadly, now I must mourn my lost son however I shall never forget your kindness,  $N, Thank you.||||||
32131|skyshrine|Sentry_Emil|say|Good, then perhaps you wouldn't mind performing a small task then? With the betrayal of Kragen Morshire, the kin retreated from the Skyshrine and have taken up residence in the Tunare Court. Before I was called to guard the gate, I had been assigned to deliver a report to them. If you indeed wish to be friend to the kin, take this report to the Wakening. Eysa Florawhisper. She will give you a token indicating that she has received the message, return this to me and we may see a reward.||||||
32132|skyshrine|Sentry_Emil|despawn|self||||||
32132|skyshrine|Sentry_Emil|say|Your service is appreciated,  $N. I cannot reward you well at this point but you have come closer to the kin, the citizens of Skyshrine.  Continue to prove your loyalty and greater rewards you may see, perhaps the greatest of all.. in time.  I must go now and report this to my superiors.  Farewell.||||||
32133|skyshrine|Sentry_Kale_|say|Very well, should you complete this task you will be doing a great service to the kin. As of late our supplies of velium ore have been growing short. We need to restock this supply but our normal source has run dry for the most part.  Word has come to us that the Coldain are sitting on a large source of this ore and while we have no love for these Coldain, we have arranged a deal with one of their velium miners. Deliver this note along with a payment of 50 platinum to Ungdin, in the Coldain mines. Bring the velium shipment back to me and I will see about a reward.||||||

32143|skyshrine|Ziglark_Whisperwing|say|You must first prove this to me before I allow you through our home.  Wenglawks of Kael is an acquaintance of ours who has been feeding us information on the storm giants' movements through Velious.  Lately our couriers to him have disappeared.  What you must do is take this request to him along with 200 platinum as payment for the storm giants' locations and return the information to me.  After you complete this task for me, we will discuss passage through the Skyshrine.||||||
32144|skyshrine|Ziglark_Whisperwing|say|Excellent, you have gotten the information back and you are still in one piece!  Perhaps you could be useful to our cause.  Here is the key to leave the Skyshrine.  Just place it on the flaming pot of the dragon statue, near the center of the pool in the courtyard.||||||

Cyrah was the name of the woman to whom I was betrothed. Unfortunately her parents forbade her from marrying a lowly bard such as myself. Her father married her off to a young merchant in Qeynos named Maligar. She married him only out of respect to her father. Her heart was truly mine, at least, so she always said. When Serra was born, I visited them both often. She was like no other, so innocent and sweet. In those few years I watched her grow up to be more and more like her mother and I saw none of the father in her appearance. I do not like Maligar, but the least we can do is inform him of his child's death. I saw his caravan pass by not more than a day ago headed to Qeynos.||||||

32232|southkarana|Ulan_Meadowgreen|say|Most impressive - all three pieces of the dwarven rune. When joined, this shall serve me well. Take this crafted pauldron with my gratitude.||||||

32237|sro|Andad_Filla|say|You still have a way to go!  Seek out Misty Tekcihta near the arena at Lake Rathe.  Run like the wind!||||||

32246|steamfont|Forpar_Fizfla|say|Wow! I didn't think a $R like you would be able to gather all of those things. Forpar rambles around and works with small tools for a good ten minutes before handing you a very fine looking lute head. 'Now, do you want to gather the next pieces for me?||||||
32247|steamfont|Forpar_Fizfla|say|Wooooooo! You are doing a wonderful job,  $N. I wish I could go out and gather these things myself.' Forpar sits back down at his desk and pulls several very strange looking tools out. Eventually he looks up at you and says, 'The body is done! Only one more piece to go!||||||
32248|steamfont|Forpar_Fizfla|say| 'Goodness! I can hardly contain myself! This will be my greatest creation ever!' Forpar sits down, slides the lute head into place and screws it together. After a few minutes, he begins to string the lute with the gut strings of the poison dragon. A wonderful sound fills the air as he strums the lute once and hands it to you.'I hope you find a good use for that! I bet you could play it from the mountaintops and the people below would hear you. Thank you,  $N, for making my lifelong dream come true!'||||||

The form of the spirit expands and takes on a humanoid shape. The air itself then seems to condense about the spirit as bits of matter appear within the glowing form. The bits soon take the shape of bones and ropes of muscle. Within minutes, an emaciated Erudite male stands before you.

Miraculously, Yuios fur begins to take on a healthy sheen and the sores begin to disappear! Yuio falls into Jali's arms then goes slack, passing out. 'She needs much rest. I cannot begin to thank you enough for helping us. Please accept this as a reward. It is not much but it should be of some use. You are indeed a friend of ours and if you ever need shelter from the wilds, please visit us again.||||||

Here is your reference as promissed.'||||||
32278|swampofnohope|Mystic_Dovan|say|I see that you have found your answers. Now I must ask you to to retrieve for the council the skulls of the Di Nozok.

This location is as strange of a destination for our spirit as it is dangerous. I have seen the spirit several times and it is very out of place here.

32311|thurgadina|Frundle_Frenkler|say|I'm no potter mind you, but if I remember correctly it's a small brick of velium, three crystalline silks, and two glass shards. Then you'll have to finish up by firing it in a kiln with a high quality firing sheet.||||||
32312|thurgadina|Gilthan_Brittleblade|say|So, you've been chosen to attempt the rune, eh? Been ages since anyone's even made an attempt. The rune represents the very essence of our people, our culture, and our religion.

32318|thurgadina|Lorekeeper_Brita|say|Ohh, that's better. I get so touchy when I'm hungry. I should probably go apologize to Derrin for being snappy. Please return this to Mordin for me.||||||
32319|thurgadina|Loremaster_Borannin|say| $N! Thank Brell you're here. I was about to send one of my Lorekeepers looking for you. It appears that the information Tanik acquired is most perilous indeed. The Dain has called an emergency session of the council and I must attend. We don't have the luxury of waiting for an appropriate task to arise, you must advance as soon as possible. Unfortunately, I have neither the time, nor the components to fashion the next few shawls for you. Ask Rexx Frostweaver about the prayer shawl and follow his direction carefully.||||||
32320|thurgadina|Loremaster_Borannin|say|Incredible! Never before has an outlander been skilled and determined enough to craft our sacred rune. You are now worthy of the Dain's most perilous task. You should seek an audience with the Dain immediately. Show him your Runed Prayer Shawl he will give you the task that has been prepared for you. If the Dain is away show your Shawl to Chamberlain Krystorf and he will call for him.||||||
32321|thurgadina|Loremaster_Borannin|say|Ahh, well done! On behalf of the Dain I thank you for making a dent in the number of our sworn enemy. Please accept this as a token of our appreciation. It is trivial, I know, but if you are as loyal as you claim to be, it will increase in power over time. It just so happens I have a task to further demonstrate your loyalty,  $N.||||||
32322|thurgadina|Loremaster_Borannin|say|Ahh, some fine specimens indeed,  $N. I will have the best of these mounted at once, wish me luck in the contest! Here is the Cloth Prayer Shawl of our people. Before I forget, the council has issued yet another chore for you to complete.||||||
32323|thurgadina|Loremaster_Borannin|say|Well done,  $N, the council will be impressed with your effort. Here is the woven prayer shawl, wear it with pride. I know there is talk of great plans for you, be sure to come back and ask me what the council has brewing.||||||
32324|thurgadina|Loremaster_Borannin|say|Words cannot express our gratitude for your deeds outlander, you have saved a hero of our people from certain death.

32325|thurgadina|Meg_Tucter|say|Oh, really? There are not many that work in faceting gems. I am surprised to see your interest. You can have this old set of mine. There is no need to return the tools, Talem recently made me a new sturdy set. Brell bless him.||||||

32331|thurgadina|Normon_Stonetooth|say|Ahhhh, good work,  $N. Now ta speak with the stone ye need somethin' ta focus on. Use this piece o' velium as yer focus. Ta speak the language o' the stone ye need ta slow down like the stone. Rock looks like it don't move but it does, just real slow. So place yer focus on the stones ye wish ta speak with and get yerself real slow, both yer body an' yer noggin. Then if yer quiet enough ye might hear 'em. An' that's what's to it.||||||

32336|thurgadina|Talem_Tucter|say|I've heard of your mission,  $N. I must admit that I had my doubts you'd make it this far. The rune's creation is nearly impossible for even the most skilled of Coldain craftsmen. You should be exceedingly proud. Many have attempted this feat and nearly all have lacked the skill, faith, patience and persistence that is prerequisite for what destiny holds in store for you. You are now ready to use this pattern to construct the sacred rune's casing and complete the runed shawl.||||||

Once that's done ye need to kneel in front of the Grand Historian in the chapel and recite this prayer to him with total sincerity in yer heart. If yer plea be heard by our Father Brell he'll bless ya with the knowledge necessary to carry on. With that knowledge you'll take the blank rune, the burin and a fletching kit to etch the rune. Show Grimthor the etched rune and he'll guide you from there.||||||

Our population has been cleansed, but we lost a full third of our army to the poisonous words of those rebels. In retaliation for your deeds, the Kromrif have made plans to attack us in this, our weakest hour. Can I count on your help outlander?||||||

However, there is yet another threat rising from the Plasmatic Priesthood that may have dire effects on all of Norrath if it is not stopped. An Iksar member of the Triumvirate missionaries has discovered that the Plasmatic Priesthood has somehow convinced the sarnak summoners of Chardok to assist them in summoning Ixilblat Fer to Norrath. Take this shell to Naxot Deepwater in the Burning Woods so that she knows I have sent you. We ask that you return with the Sceptre of Ixiblat Fer as well as evidence to show that the Plasmatic Priesthood is dealing with sarnaks. High Priest Omat will await your return. I must depart now.

I thank you for delivering Naxot's message to me and give you this pearl imbued with the power of the Triumvirate. Should you find Zordak Ragefire, speak with him before all else and hand him this pearl. No mortal enemy of the Triumvirate can resist its enchantments.'||||||
32375|timorous|Omat_Vastsea|say|So, you are a friend of Natasha's? That is good to see. She is a very wise and gifted woman. The Riptide goblins have adopted a new king but are still in a vulnerable state until his subjects accept his rule. The Plasmatic Priesthood is aware of the weakened state of the Riptides and has convinced the Fire Peak goblins to strike against them. Although I do not agree with the mannerisms or actions of any goblin clan, such a war would be detrimental to all who are caught in its path. Lord Gimblox of the Fire Peak clan has been meeting with a member of the Plasmatic Priesthood in the Temple of Solusek Ro. Locate the Plasmatic Priest, hand him this statue to hinder his powers, then eliminate him and bring me his robe.||||||

The fact that the Plasmatic Priesthood has mustered up the power to summon such a being means drastic actions must be taken to stop the fanatic cult of Fennin Ro. I wonder what kind of favor Zordak Ragefire performed for the sarnak summoners to convince them to assist in the ritual that brought forth Ixiblat Fer. The dragon Iksar hybrid abominations are not beings who ally with others easily. All I have seen in my divinations of the High Plasmatic Priest are riddles, and signs that the one who slays him may be awarded an Orb of the Triumvirate. If you are the one whom my visions foretell, then seek Zordak Ragefire and bring me his heart.||||||

Well then,  $N, your first assignment will be to clear out some of this forest's annoying populace. Bring me the meat of one of the raptors, the meat of two panthers, and the remains of one of those living puddles of black sludge found in the caves. You will then have your payment.||||||

You have also earned this cloak, it should help protect you from the clawing undergrowth of this savage land. Your next mission will be more complex and dangerous, however we may be able to spare a laborer or two to assist you. Rest now, and tell me when you are prepared.||||||
32428|wakening|Lieutenant_Krofer|emote|%s takes the note and looks it over, then sighs and says, 'This will have to be enough. The squad should be here shortly. When they arrive you will march with them to the staging area near the village of those insect Sifaye. When you are satisfied with the formation, give the corporal the order to attack and observe the battle. After the village is destroyed return this report to me and we'll plan our next move.'||||||

I have yet another favor to ask of you as well. Fill this empty bag with crystallized sulfur. When mixed with the crushed herbs in the other bag it will create an explosion strong enough to destroy stone. Take the two full bags into Kael Drakkel and plant it into a crate of the kromzeks building supplies.||||||

You have come just in time. We need you to take this pack and fill it with goblin warlord warbeads. Combine the beads in the pack and return it to me.||||||
32455|warslikswood|Warlord_Vyzer|say|I am glad to see they have sent a strong new recruit. I have a task for you which will require you to recover a few pages of a certain poem I once wrote. I never should have written of such weak-minded things, but the pages were stolen from me before I could destroy them. Take this poem binder and find the thieves. When you combine the pages in the binder, it will magically lock and you may return it to me for your prize, the geozite tool.||||||
32456|warslikswood|Warlord_Vyzer|say|Great work!! You have saved me from disgrace. I reward you with the geozite tool. You may find its purpose within Cabils' warriors guild. A true Iksar warrior should always have one.||||||

32470|westwastes|The_Dragon_Sage|say|The name of the plant eludes me at this time, for my thoughts have grown cold through the ages. The findings of the giants were written in a book of lore by some of our sages. You should seek out one of the giants Tomekeepers. If you find a Tomekeeper, ask him about the herb that harms dragons. Perhaps if you give him this trinket he will assist you. Maybe they will remember my tired soul.||||||

According to this book, the dragonbane herb grows only in one place, deep inside the lair of the sirens. If my memory serves me properly one of the creatures there is very fond of its flavor. I will also need the blood of a dragon, but not just any dragon. The blood must come from a beast of Lord Yelinak's bloodline. Please go now and see if you can find this herb and the dragon blood. No time to waste, child. You will need to take this box to contain and combine the herbs and dragon blood in. Once you have accomplished this, please return the box to me.||||||

If successful, I will call it the Porlos' Fury spell. It will cause near fatal wounds to any dragon or dragon kin in Lord Yelinak's bloodline. Take this and study it. The magiks contained within will aid you in your fight. The Dragon Sage hands you the scroll and says, 'You will need a reagent to channel the magical energies through to enhance the power of the spell. Two peridots will be required to cast this spell. I wish you good fortune in your fight.||||||
